Walk in the Light","42":"Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;","43":"for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.","44":"Then Jesus cried out and said, \u201cHe who believes in Me, believes not in Me but in Him who sent Me.","45":"And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.","46":"I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness.","47":"And if anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.","48":"He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him\u2014the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day.","49":"For I have not spoken on My own authority; but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say and what I should speak.","50":"And I know that His command is everlasting life.

And when He had spoken this, He said to him, \u201cFollow Me.\u201d The Beloved Disciple and His Book","20":"Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also had leaned on His breast at the supper, and said, \u201cLord, who is the one who betrays You?\u201d","21":"Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, \u201cBut Lord, what about this man?\u201d","22":"Jesus said to him, \u201cIf I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you? You follow Me.\u201d","23":"Then this saying went out among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, \u201cIf I will that he remain till I come, what is that to you?\u201d","24":"This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.","25":"And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written. Amen."}}
