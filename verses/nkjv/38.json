Mourning for the Pierced One","10":"\u201cAnd I will pour on the house of David and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of grace and supplication; then they will look on Me whom they pierced. Yes, they will mourn for Him as one mourns for his only son, and grieve for Him as one grieves for a firstborn.","11":"In that day there shall be a great mourning in Jerusalem, like the mourning at Hadad Rimmon in the plain of Megiddo.","12":"And the land shall mourn, every family by itself: the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves;","13":"the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of Shimei by itself, and their wives by themselves;","14":"all the families that remain, every family by itself, and their wives by themselves."},"13":{"1":"\u201cIn that day a fountain shall be opened for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for sin and for uncleanness.","2":"\u201cIt shall be in that day,\u201d says the Lord of hosts, \u201cthat I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, and they shall no longer be remembered. I will also cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to depart from the land.","3":"It shall come to pass that if anyone still prophesies, then his father and mother who begot him will say to him, \u2018You shall not live, because you have spoken lies in the name of the Lord.\u2019 And his father and mother who begot him shall thrust him through when he prophesies.","4":"\u201cAnd it shall be in that day that every prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies; they will not wear a robe of coarse hair to deceive.","5":"But he will say, \u2018I am no prophet, I am a farmer; for a man taught me to keep cattle from my youth.\u2019","6":"And one will say to him, \u2018What are these wounds between your arms?\u2019 Then he will answer, \u2018Those with which I was wounded in the house of my friends.\u2019 The Shepherd Savior","7":"\u201cAwake, O sword, against My Shepherd, Against the Man who is My Companion,\u201d Says the Lord of hosts. \u201cStrike the Shepherd, And the sheep will be scattered; Then I will turn My hand against the little ones.","8":"And it shall come to pass in all the land,\u201d Says the Lord, \u201cThat two-thirds in it shall be cut off and die, But one \u2013third shall be left in it:","9":"I will bring the one \u2013third through the fire, Will refine them as silver is refined, And test them as gold is tested. They will call on My name, And I will answer them.

And the Mount of Olives shall be split in two, From east to west, Making a very large valley; Half of the mountain shall move toward the north And half of it toward the south.","5":"Then you shall flee through My mountain valley, For the mountain valley shall reach to Azal. Yes, you shall flee As you fled from the earthquake In the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Thus the Lord my God will come, And all the saints with You.","6":"It shall come to pass in that day That there will be no light; The lights will diminish.","7":"It shall be one day Which is known to the Lord\u2014 Neither day nor night. But at evening time it shall happen That it will be light.","8":"And in that day it shall be That living waters shall flow from Jerusalem, Half of them toward the eastern sea And half of them toward the western sea; In both summer and winter it shall occur.","9":"And the Lord shall be King over all the earth.
