{"1":{"1":"Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass that the children of Israel asked the Lord, saying, \u201cWho shall be first to go up for us against the Canaanites to fight against them?\u201d","2":"And the Lord said, \u201cJudah shall go up. Indeed I have delivered the land into his hand.\u201d","3":"So Judah said to Simeon his brother, \u201cCome up with me to my allotted territory, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I will likewise go with you to your allotted territory.\u201d And Simeon went with him.","4":"Then Judah went up, and the Lord delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand; and they killed ten thousand men at Bezek.","5":"And they found Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fought against him; and they defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites.","6":"Then Adoni-Bezek fled, and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.","7":"And Adoni-Bezek said, \u201cSeventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has repaid me.\u201d Then they brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.","8":"Now the children of Judah fought against Jerusalem and took it; they struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire.","9":"And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the mountains, in the South, and in the lowland.","10":"Then Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron. (Now the name of Hebron was formerly Kirjath Arba.) And they killed Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.","11":"From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. (The name of Debir was formerly Kirjath Sepher.)","12":"Then Caleb said, \u201cWhoever attacks Kirjath Sepher and takes it, to him I will give my daughter Achsah as wife.\u201d","13":"And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb\u2019s younger brother, took it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as wife.","14":"Now it happened, when she came to him, that she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, \u201cWhat do you wish?\u201d","15":"So she said to him, \u201cGive me a blessing; since you have given me land in the South, give me also springs of water.\u201d And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.","16":"Now the children of the Kenite, Moses\u2019 father-in-law, went up from the City of Palms with the children of Judah into the Wilderness of Judah, which lies in the South near Arad; and they went and dwelt among the people.","17":"And Judah went with his brother Simeon, and they attacked the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah.","18":"Also Judah took Gaza with its territory, Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.","19":"So the Lord was with Judah. And they drove out the mountaineers, but they could not drive out the inhabitants of the lowland, because they had chariots of iron.","20":"And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said. Then he expelled from there the three sons of Anak.","21":"But the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; so the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.","22":"And the house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them.","23":"So the house of Joseph sent men to spy out Bethel. (The name of the city was formerly Luz.)","24":"And when the spies saw a man coming out of the city, they said to him, \u201cPlease show us the entrance to the city, and we will show you mercy.\u201d","25":"So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword; but they let the man and all his family go.","26":"And the man went to the land of the Hittites, built a city, and called its name Luz, which is its name to this day. Incomplete Conquest of the Land","27":"However, Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; for the Canaanites were determined to dwell in that land.","28":"And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the Canaanites under tribute, but did not completely drive them out.","29":"Nor did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; so the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.","30":"Nor did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol; so the Canaanites dwelt among them, and were put under tribute.","31":"Nor did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Acco or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob.","32":"So the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.","33":"Nor did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh or the inhabitants of Beth Anath; but they dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth Shemesh and Beth Anath were put under tribute to them.","34":"And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountains, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley;","35":"and the Amorites were determined to dwell in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; yet when the strength of the house of Joseph became greater, they were put under tribute.","36":"Now the boundary of the Amorites was from the Ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela, and upward."},"2":{"1":"Then the Angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and said: \u201cI led you up from Egypt and brought you to the land of which I swore to your fathers; and I said, \u2018I will never break My covenant with you.","2":"And you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.\u2019 But you have not obeyed My voice. Why have you done this?","3":"Therefore I also said, \u2018I will not drive them out before you; but they shall be thorns in your side, and their gods shall be a snare to you.\u2019 \u201d","4":"So it was, when the Angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the children of Israel, that the people lifted up their voices and wept.","5":"Then they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there to the Lord.","6":"And when Joshua had dismissed the people, the children of Israel went each to his own inheritance to possess the land. Death of Joshua","7":"So the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the Lord which He had done for Israel.","8":"Now Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died when he was one hundred and ten years old.","9":"And they buried him within the border of his inheritance at Timnath Heres, in the mountains of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.","10":"When all that generation had been gathered to their fathers, another generation arose after them who did not know the Lord nor the work which He had done for Israel. Israel\u2019s Unfaithfulness","11":"Then the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord, and served the Baals;","12":"and they forsook the Lord God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; and they followed other gods from among the gods of the people who were all around them, and they bowed down to them; and they provoked the Lord to anger.","13":"They forsook the Lord and served Baal and the Ashtoreths.","14":"And the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel. So He delivered them into the hands of plunderers who despoiled them; and He sold them into the hands of their enemies all around, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.","15":"Wherever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for calamity, as the Lord had said, and as the Lord had sworn to them. And they were greatly distressed.","16":"Nevertheless, the Lord raised up judges who delivered them out of the hand of those who plundered them.","17":"Yet they would not listen to their judges, but they played the harlot with other gods, and bowed down to them. They turned quickly from the way in which their fathers walked, in obeying the commandments of the Lord; they did not do so.","18":"And when the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord was with the judge and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed them and harassed them.","19":"And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they reverted and behaved more corruptly than their fathers, by following other gods, to serve them and bow down to them. They did not cease from their own doings nor from their stubborn way.","20":"Then the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel; and He said, \u201cBecause this nation has transgressed My covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not heeded My voice,","21":"I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left when he died,","22":"so that through them I may test Israel, whether they will keep the ways of the Lord, to walk in them as their fathers kept them, or not.\u201d","23":"Therefore the Lord left those nations, without driving them out immediately; nor did He deliver them into the hand of Joshua."},"3":{"1":"Now these are the nations which the Lord left, that He might test Israel by them, that is, all who had not known any of the wars in Canaan","2":"(this was only so that the generations of the children of Israel might be taught to know war, at least those who had not formerly known it),","3":"namely, five lords of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who dwelt in Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal Hermon to the entrance of Hamath.","4":"And they were left, that He might test Israel by them, to know whether they would obey the commandments of the Lord, which He had commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.","5":"Thus the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.","6":"And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their daughters to their sons; and they served their gods. Othniel","7":"So the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the Lord. They forgot the Lord their God, and served the Baals and Asherahs.","8":"Therefore the anger of the Lord was hot against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the children of Israel served Cushan-Rishathaim eight years.","9":"When the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for the children of Israel, who delivered them: Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb\u2019s younger brother.","10":"The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the Lord delivered Cushan-Rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cushan-Rishathaim.","11":"So the land had rest for forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died. Ehud","12":"And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord. So the Lord strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the Lord.","13":"Then he gathered to himself the people of Ammon and Amalek, went and defeated Israel, and took possession of the City of Palms.","14":"So the children of Israel served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.","15":"But when the children of Israel cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for them: Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. By him the children of Israel sent tribute to Eglon king of Moab.","16":"Now Ehud made himself a dagger (it was double-edged and a cubit in length) and fastened it under his clothes on his right thigh.","17":"So he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. (Now Eglon was a very fat man.)","18":"And when he had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried the tribute.","19":"But he himself turned back from the stone images that were at Gilgal, and said, \u201cI have a secret message for you, O king.\u201d He said, \u201cKeep silence!\u201d And all who attended him went out from him.","20":"So Ehud came to him (now he was sitting upstairs in his cool private chamber). Then Ehud said, \u201cI have a message from God for you.\u201d So he arose from his seat.","21":"Then Ehud reached with his left hand, took the dagger from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly.","22":"Even the hilt went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the dagger out of his belly; and his entrails came out.","23":"Then Ehud went out through the porch and shut the doors of the upper room behind him and locked them.","24":"When he had gone out, Eglon\u2019s servants came to look, and to their surprise, the doors of the upper room were locked. So they said, \u201cHe is probably attending to his needs in the cool chamber.\u201d","25":"So they waited till they were embarrassed, and still he had not opened the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key and opened them. And there was their master, fallen dead on the floor.","26":"But Ehud had escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the stone images and escaped to Seirah.","27":"And it happened, when he arrived, that he blew the trumpet in the mountains of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from the mountains; and he led them.","28":"Then he said to them, \u201cFollow me, for the Lord has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand.\u201d So they went down after him, seized the fords of the Jordan leading to Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross over.","29":"And at that time they killed about ten thousand men of Moab, all stout men of valor; not a man escaped.","30":"So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years. Shamgar","31":"After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox goad; and he also delivered Israel."},"4":{"1":"When Ehud was dead, the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the Lord.","2":"So the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who dwelt in Harosheth Hagoyim.","3":"And the children of Israel cried out to the Lord; for Jabin had nine hundred chariots of iron, and for twenty years he had harshly oppressed the children of Israel.","4":"Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, was judging Israel at that time.","5":"And she would sit under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountains of Ephraim. And the children of Israel came up to her for judgment.","6":"Then she sent and called for Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh in Naphtali, and said to him, \u201cHas not the Lord God of Israel commanded, \u2018Go and deploy troops at Mount Tabor; take with you ten thousand men of the sons of Naphtali and of the sons of Zebulun;","7":"and against you I will deploy Sisera, the commander of Jabin\u2019s army, with his chariots and his multitude at the River Kishon; and I will deliver him into your hand\u2019?\u201d","8":"And Barak said to her, \u201cIf you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go!\u201d","9":"So she said, \u201cI will surely go with you; nevertheless there will be no glory for you in the journey you are taking, for the Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.\u201d Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh.","10":"And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; he went up with ten thousand men under his command, and Deborah went up with him.","11":"Now Heber the Kenite, of the children of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, had separated himself from the Kenites and pitched his tent near the terebinth tree at Zaanaim, which is beside Kedesh.","12":"And they reported to Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor.","13":"So Sisera gathered together all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth Hagoyim to the River Kishon.","14":"Then Deborah said to Barak, \u201cUp! For this is the day in which the Lord has delivered Sisera into your hand. Has not the Lord gone out before you?\u201d So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.","15":"And the Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot.","16":"But Barak pursued the chariots and the army as far as Harosheth Hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.","17":"However, Sisera had fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite; for there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.","18":"And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, \u201cTurn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; do not fear.\u201d And when he had turned aside with her into the tent, she covered him with a blanket.","19":"Then he said to her, \u201cPlease give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty.\u201d So she opened a jug of milk, gave him a drink, and covered him.","20":"And he said to her, \u201cStand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and inquires of you, and says, \u2018Is there any man here?\u2019 you shall say, \u2018No.\u2019 \u201d","21":"Then Jael, Heber\u2019s wife, took a tent peg and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, and it went down into the ground; for he was fast asleep and weary.

Awake, awake, sing a song! Arise, Barak, and lead your captives away, O son of Abinoam!","13":"\u201cThen the survivors came down, the people against the nobles; The Lord came down for me against the mighty.","14":"From Ephraim were those whose roots were in Amalek.

The divisions of Reuben have great searchings of heart.","17":"Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan, And why did Dan remain on ships? Asher continued at the seashore, And stayed by his inlets.","18":"Zebulun is a people who jeopardized their lives to the point of death, Naphtali also, on the heights of the battlefield.","19":"\u201cThe kings came and fought, Then the kings of Canaan fought In Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; They took no spoils of silver.","20":"They fought from the heavens; The stars from their courses fought against Sisera.","21":"The torrent of Kishon swept them away, That ancient torrent, the torrent of Kishon. O my soul, march on in strength!","22":"Then the horses\u2019 hooves pounded, The galloping, galloping of his steeds.","23":"\u2018Curse Meroz,\u2019 said the angel of the Lord, \u2018Curse its inhabitants bitterly, Because they did not come to the help of the Lord, To the help of the Lord against the mighty.\u2019","24":"\u201cMost blessed among women is Jael, The wife of Heber the Kenite; Blessed is she among women in tents.","25":"He asked for water, she gave milk; She brought out cream in a lordly bowl.","26":"She stretched her hand to the tent peg, Her right hand to the workmen\u2019s hammer; She pounded Sisera, she pierced his head, She split and struck through his temple.","27":"At her feet he sank, he fell, he lay still; At her feet he sank, he fell; Where he sank, there he fell dead.","28":"\u201cThe mother of Sisera looked through the window, And cried out through the lattice, \u2018Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarries the clatter of his chariots?\u2019","29":"Her wisest ladies answered her, Yes, she answered herself,","30":"\u2018Are they not finding and dividing the spoil: To every man a girl or two; For Sisera, plunder of dyed garments, Plunder of garments embroidered and dyed, Two pieces of dyed embroidery for the neck of the looter?\u2019","31":"\u201cThus let all Your enemies perish, O Lord!

Then it will be, that of whom I say to you, \u2018This one shall go with you,\u2019 the same shall go with you; and of whomever I say to you, \u2018This one shall not go with you,\u2019 the same shall not go.\u201d","5":"So he brought the people down to the water. And the Lord said to Gideon, \u201cEveryone who laps from the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set apart by himself; likewise everyone who gets down on his knees to drink.\u201d","6":"And the number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people got down on their knees to drink water.","7":"Then the Lord said to Gideon, \u201cBy the three hundred men who lapped I will save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand. Let all the other people go, every man to his place.\u201d","8":"So the people took provisions and their trumpets in their hands. And he sent away all the rest of Israel, every man to his tent, and retained those three hundred men. Now the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.","9":"It happened on the same night that the Lord said to him, \u201cArise, go down against the camp, for I have delivered it into your hand.","10":"But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant,","11":"and you shall hear what they say; and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp.\u201d Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outpost of the armed men who were in the camp.","12":"Now the Midianites and Amalekites, all the people of the East, were lying in the valley as numerous as locusts; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the seashore in multitude.","13":"And when Gideon had come, there was a man telling a dream to his companion. He said, \u201cI have had a dream: To my surprise, a loaf of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian; it came to a tent and struck it so that it fell and overturned, and the tent collapsed.\u201d","14":"Then his companion answered and said, \u201cThis is nothing else but the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel! Into his hand God has delivered Midian and the whole camp.\u201d","15":"And so it was, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, that he worshiped. He returned to the camp of Israel, and said, \u201cArise, for the Lord has delivered the camp of Midian into your hand.\u201d","16":"Then he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put a trumpet into every man\u2019s hand, with empty pitchers, and torches inside the pitchers.","17":"And he said to them, \u201cLook at me and do likewise; watch, and when I come to the edge of the camp you shall do as I do:","18":"When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then you also blow the trumpets on every side of the whole camp, and say, \u2018The sword of the Lord and of Gideon!\u2019 \u201d","19":"So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outpost of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, just as they had posted the watch; and they blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers that were in their hands.","20":"Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers\u2014they held the torches in their left hands and the trumpets in their right hands for blowing\u2014and they cried, \u201cThe sword of the Lord and of Gideon!\u201d","21":"And every man stood in his place all around the camp; and the whole army ran and cried out and fled.","22":"When the three hundred blew the trumpets, the Lord set every man\u2019s sword against his companion throughout the whole camp; and the army fled to Beth Acacia, toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel Meholah, by Tabbath.","23":"And the men of Israel gathered together from Naphtali, Asher, and all Manasseh, and pursued the Midianites.","24":"Then Gideon sent messengers throughout all the mountains of Ephraim, saying, \u201cCome down against the Midianites, and seize from them the watering places as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan.\u201d Then all the men of Ephraim gathered together and seized the watering places as far as Beth Barah and the Jordan.","25":"And they captured two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. They pursued Midian and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side of the Jordan."},"8":{"1":"Now the men of Ephraim said to him, \u201cWhy have you done this to us by not calling us when you went to fight with the Midianites?\u201d And they reprimanded him sharply.","2":"So he said to them, \u201cWhat have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?","3":"God has delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. And what was I able to do in comparison with you?\u201d Then their anger toward him subsided when he said that.","4":"When Gideon came to the Jordan, he and the three hundred men who were with him crossed over, exhausted but still in pursuit.","5":"Then he said to the men of Succoth, \u201cPlease give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.\u201d","6":"And the leaders of Succoth said, \u201cAre the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?\u201d","7":"So Gideon said, \u201cFor this cause, when the Lord has delivered Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, then I will tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers!\u201d","8":"Then he went up from there to Penuel and spoke to them in the same way.

As the Lord lives, if you had let them live, I would not kill you.\u201d","20":"And he said to Jether his firstborn, \u201cRise, kill them!\u201d But the youth would not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was still a youth.","21":"So Zebah and Zalmunna said, \u201cRise yourself, and kill us; for as a man is, so is his strength.\u201d So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent ornaments that were on their camels\u2019 necks.

However, the name of the city formerly was Laish.","30":"Then the children of Dan set up for themselves the carved image; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.","31":"So they set up for themselves Micah\u2019s carved image which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh."},"19":{"1":"And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite staying in the remote mountains of Ephraim. He took for himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.","2":"But his concubine played the harlot against him, and went away from him to her father\u2019s house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there four whole months.","3":"Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back, having his servant and a couple of donkeys with him. So she brought him into her father\u2019s house; and when the father of the young woman saw him, he was glad to meet him.","4":"Now his father-in-law, the young woman\u2019s father, detained him; and he stayed with him three days. So they ate and drank and lodged there.","5":"Then it came to pass on the fourth day that they arose early in the morning, and he stood to depart; but the young woman\u2019s father said to his son-in-law, \u201cRefresh your heart with a morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.\u201d","6":"So they sat down, and the two of them ate and drank together. Then the young woman\u2019s father said to the man, \u201cPlease be content to stay all night, and let your heart be merry.\u201d","7":"And when the man stood to depart, his father-in-law urged him; so he lodged there again.","8":"Then he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart, but the young woman\u2019s father said, \u201cPlease refresh your heart.\u201d So they delayed until afternoon; and both of them ate.","9":"And when the man stood to depart\u2014he and his concubine and his servant\u2014his father-in-law, the young woman\u2019s father, said to him, \u201cLook, the day is now drawing toward evening; please spend the night. See, the day is coming to an end; lodge here, that your heart may be merry. Tomorrow go your way early, so that you may get home.\u201d","10":"However, the man was not willing to spend that night; so he rose and departed, and came opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). With him were the two saddled donkeys; his concubine was also with him.","11":"They were near Jebus, and the day was far spent; and the servant said to his master, \u201cCome, please, and let us turn aside into this city of the Jebusites and lodge in it.\u201d","12":"But his master said to him, \u201cWe will not turn aside here into a city of foreigners, who are not of the children of Israel; we will go on to Gibeah.\u201d","13":"So he said to his servant, \u201cCome, let us draw near to one of these places, and spend the night in Gibeah or in Ramah.\u201d","14":"And they passed by and went their way; and the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin.","15":"They turned aside there to go in to lodge in Gibeah. And when he went in, he sat down in the open square of the city, for no one would take them into his house to spend the night.","16":"Just then an old man came in from his work in the field at evening, who also was from the mountains of Ephraim; he was staying in Gibeah, whereas the men of the place were Benjamites.","17":"And when he raised his eyes, he saw the traveler in the open square of the city; and the old man said, \u201cWhere are you going, and where do you come from?\u201d","18":"So he said to him, \u201cWe are passing from Bethlehem in Judah toward the remote mountains of Ephraim; I am from there. I went to Bethlehem in Judah; now I am going to the house of the Lord. But there is no one who will take me into his house,","19":"although we have both straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for myself, for your female servant, and for the young man who is with your servant; there is no lack of anything.\u201d","20":"And the old man said, \u201cPeace be with you! However, let all your needs be my responsibility; only do not spend the night in the open square.\u201d","21":"So he brought him into his house, and gave fodder to the donkeys. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank. Gibeah\u2019s Crime","22":"As they were enjoying themselves, suddenly certain men of the city, perverted men, surrounded the house and beat on the door. They spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, \u201cBring out the man who came to your house, that we may know him carnally! \u201d","23":"But the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, \u201cNo, my brethren! I beg you, do not act so wickedly! Seeing this man has come into my house, do not commit this outrage.","24":"Look, here is my virgin daughter and the man\u2019s concubine; let me bring them out now. Humble them, and do with them as you please; but to this man do not do such a vile thing!\u201d","25":"But the men would not heed him. So the man took his concubine and brought her out to them. And they knew her and abused her all night until morning; and when the day began to break, they let her go.","26":"Then the woman came as the day was dawning, and fell down at the door of the man\u2019s house where her master was, till it was light.","27":"When her master arose in the morning, and opened the doors of the house and went out to go his way, there was his concubine, fallen at the door of the house with her hands on the threshold.","28":"And he said to her, \u201cGet up and let us be going.\u201d But there was no answer. So the man lifted her onto the donkey; and the man got up and went to his place.","29":"When he entered his house he took a knife, laid hold of his concubine, and divided her into twelve pieces, limb by limb, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel.","30":"And so it was that all who saw it said, \u201cNo such deed has been done or seen from the day that the children of Israel came up from the land of Egypt until this day. Consider it, confer, and speak up!\u201d"},"20":{"1":"So all the children of Israel came out, from Dan to Beersheba, as well as from the land of Gilead, and the congregation gathered together as one man before the Lord at Mizpah.","2":"And the leaders of all the people, all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand foot soldiers who drew the sword.","3":"(Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) Then the children of Israel said, \u201cTell us, how did this wicked deed happen?\u201d","4":"So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, \u201cMy concubine and I went into Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, to spend the night.","5":"And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me, but instead they ravished my concubine so that she died.","6":"So I took hold of my concubine, cut her in pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of the inheritance of Israel, because they committed lewdness and outrage in Israel.","7":"Look! All of you are children of Israel; give your advice and counsel here and now!\u201d","8":"So all the people arose as one man, saying, \u201cNone of us will go to his tent, nor will any turn back to his house;","9":"but now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah: We will go up against it by lot.","10":"We will take ten men out of every hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, a hundred out of every thousand, and a thousand out of every ten thousand, to make provisions for the people, that when they come to Gibeah in Benjamin, they may repay all the vileness that they have done in Israel.\u201d","11":"So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, united together as one man.","12":"Then the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, \u201cWhat is this wickedness that has occurred among you?","13":"Now therefore, deliver up the men, the perverted men who are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and remove the evil from Israel!\u201d But the children of Benjamin would not listen to the voice of their brethren, the children of Israel.","14":"Instead, the children of Benjamin gathered together from their cities to Gibeah, to go to battle against the children of Israel.","15":"And from their cities at that time the children of Benjamin numbered twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered seven hundred select men.","16":"Among all this people were seven hundred select men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair\u2019s breadth and not miss.","17":"Now besides Benjamin, the men of Israel numbered four hundred thousand men who drew the sword; all of these were men of war.","18":"Then the children of Israel arose and went up to the house of God to inquire of God. They said, \u201cWhich of us shall go up first to battle against the children of Benjamin?\u201d The Lord said, \u201cJudah first!\u201d","19":"So the children of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah.","20":"And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and the men of Israel put themselves in battle array to fight against them at Gibeah.","21":"Then the children of Benjamin came out of Gibeah, and on that day cut down to the ground twenty-two thousand men of the Israelites.","22":"And the people, that is, the men of Israel, encouraged themselves and again formed the battle line at the place where they had put themselves in array on the first day.","23":"Then the children of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until evening, and asked counsel of the Lord, saying, \u201cShall I again draw near for battle against the children of my brother Benjamin?\u201d And the Lord said, \u201cGo up against him.\u201d","24":"So the children of Israel approached the children of Benjamin on the second day.","25":"And Benjamin went out against them from Gibeah on the second day, and cut down to the ground eighteen thousand more of the children of Israel; all these drew the sword.","26":"Then all the children of Israel, that is, all the people, went up and came to the house of God and wept. They sat there before the Lord and fasted that day until evening; and they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord.","27":"So the children of Israel inquired of the Lord (the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days,","28":"and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood before it in those days), saying, \u201cShall I yet again go out to battle against the children of my brother Benjamin, or shall I cease?\u201d And the Lord said, \u201cGo up, for tomorrow I will deliver them into your hand.\u201d","29":"Then Israel set men in ambush all around Gibeah.","30":"And the children of Israel went up against the children of Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in battle array against Gibeah as at the other times.","31":"So the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city. They began to strike down and kill some of the people, as at the other times, in the highways (one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah) and in the field, about thirty men of Israel.","32":"And the children of Benjamin said, \u201cThey are defeated before us, as at first.\u201d But the children of Israel said, \u201cLet us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways.\u201d","33":"So all the men of Israel rose from their place and put themselves in battle array at Baal Tamar. Then Israel\u2019s men in ambush burst forth from their position in the plain of Geba.","34":"And ten thousand select men from all Israel came against Gibeah, and the battle was fierce. But the Benjamites did not know that disaster was upon them.","35":"The Lord defeated Benjamin before Israel. And the children of Israel destroyed that day twenty-five thousand one hundred Benjamites; all these drew the sword.","36":"So the children of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. The men of Israel had given ground to the Benjamites, because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah.","37":"And the men in ambush quickly rushed upon Gibeah; the men in ambush spread out and struck the whole city with the edge of the sword.","38":"Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise up from the city,","39":"whereupon the men of Israel would turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty of the men of Israel. For they said, \u201cSurely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle.\u201d","40":"But when the cloud began to rise from the city in a column of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and there was the whole city going up in smoke to heaven.","41":"And when the men of Israel turned back, the men of Benjamin panicked, for they saw that disaster had come upon them.","42":"Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them, and whoever came out of the cities they destroyed in their midst.","43":"They surrounded the Benjamites, chased them, and easily trampled them down as far as the front of Gibeah toward the east.","44":"And eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell; all these were men of valor.","45":"Then they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon; and they cut down five thousand of them on the highways. Then they pursued them relentlessly up to Gidom, and killed two thousand of them.","46":"So all who fell of Benjamin that day were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword; all these were men of valor.","47":"But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and they stayed at the rock of Rimmon for four months.","48":"And the men of Israel turned back against the children of Benjamin, and struck them down with the edge of the sword\u2014from every city, men and beasts, all who were found. They also set fire to all the cities they came to."},"21":{"1":"Now the men of Israel had sworn an oath at Mizpah, saying, \u201cNone of us shall give his daughter to Benjamin as a wife.\u201d","2":"Then the people came to the house of God, and remained there before God till evening. They lifted up their voices and wept bitterly,","3":"and said, \u201cO Lord God of Israel, why has this come to pass in Israel, that today there should be one tribe missing in Israel?\u201d","4":"So it was, on the next morning, that the people rose early and built an altar there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.","5":"The children of Israel said, \u201cWho is there among all the tribes of Israel who did not come up with the assembly to the Lord?\u201d For they had made a great oath concerning anyone who had not come up to the Lord at Mizpah, saying, \u201cHe shall surely be put to death.\u201d","6":"And the children of Israel grieved for Benjamin their brother, and said, \u201cOne tribe is cut off from Israel today.","7":"What shall we do for wives for those who remain, seeing we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them our daughters as wives?\u201d","8":"And they said, \u201cWhat one is there from the tribes of Israel who did not come up to Mizpah to the Lord?\u201d And, in fact, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh Gilead to the assembly.","9":"For when the people were counted, indeed, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead was there.","10":"So the congregation sent out there twelve thousand of their most valiant men, and commanded them, saying, \u201cGo and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword, including the women and children.","11":"And this is the thing that you shall do: You shall utterly destroy every male, and every woman who has known a man intimately.\u201d","12":"So they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.","13":"Then the whole congregation sent word to the children of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and announced peace to them.","14":"So Benjamin came back at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh Gilead; and yet they had not found enough for them.","15":"And the people grieved for Benjamin, because the Lord had made a void in the tribes of Israel.","16":"Then the elders of the congregation said, \u201cWhat shall we do for wives for those who remain, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?\u201d","17":"And they said, \u201cThere must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe may not be destroyed from Israel.","18":"However, we cannot give them wives from our daughters, for the children of Israel have sworn an oath, saying, \u2018Cursed be the one who gives a wife to Benjamin.\u2019 \u201d","19":"Then they said, \u201cIn fact, there is a yearly feast of the Lord in Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah.\u201d","20":"Therefore they instructed the children of Benjamin, saying, \u201cGo, lie in wait in the vineyards,","21":"and watch; and just when the daughters of Shiloh come out to perform their dances, then come out from the vineyards, and every man catch a wife for himself from the daughters of Shiloh; then go to the land of Benjamin.","22":"Then it shall be, when their fathers or their brothers come to us to complain, that we will say to them, \u2018Be kind to them for our sakes, because we did not take a wife for any of them in the war; for it is not as though you have given the women to them at this time, making yourselves guilty of your oath.\u2019 \u201d","23":"And the children of Benjamin did so; they took enough wives for their number from those who danced, whom they caught. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and they rebuilt the cities and dwelt in them.","24":"So the children of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family; they went out from there, every man to his inheritance.","25":"In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes."}}
