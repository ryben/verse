Thus he warned him, and he was watchful there, not just once or twice.","11":"Therefore the heart of the king of Syria was greatly troubled by this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, \u201cWill you not show me which of us is for the king of Israel?\u201d","12":"And one of his servants said, \u201cNone, my lord, O king; but Elisha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedroom.\u201d","13":"So he said, \u201cGo and see where he is, that I may send and get him.\u201d And it was told him, saying, \u201cSurely he is in Dothan.\u201d","14":"Therefore he sent horses and chariots and a great army there, and they came by night and surrounded the city.","15":"And when the servant of the man of God arose early and went out, there was an army, surrounding the city with horses and chariots. And his servant said to him, \u201cAlas, my master! What shall we do?\u201d","16":"So he answered, \u201cDo not fear, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them.\u201d","17":"And Elisha prayed, and said, \u201cLord, I pray, open his eyes that he may see.\u201d Then the Lord opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw. And behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.","18":"So when the Syrians came down to him, Elisha prayed to the Lord, and said, \u201cStrike this people, I pray, with blindness.\u201d And He struck them with blindness according to the word of Elisha.","19":"Now Elisha said to them, \u201cThis is not the way, nor is this the city. Follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek.\u201d But he led them to Samaria.","20":"So it was, when they had come to Samaria, that Elisha said, \u201cLord, open the eyes of these men, that they may see.\u201d And the Lord opened their eyes, and they saw; and there they were, inside Samaria!","21":"Now when the king of Israel saw them, he said to Elisha, \u201cMy father, shall I kill them? Shall I kill them? \u201d","22":"But he answered, \u201cYou shall not kill them. Would you kill those whom you have taken captive with your sword and your bow? Set food and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master.\u201d","23":"Then he prepared a great feast for them; and after they ate and drank, he sent them away and they went to their master. So the bands of Syrian raiders came no more into the land of Israel. Syria Besieges Samaria in Famine","24":"And it happened after this that Ben-Hadad king of Syria gathered all his army, and went up and besieged Samaria.","25":"And there was a great famine in Samaria; and indeed they besieged it until a donkey\u2019s head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and one-fourth of a kab of dove droppings for five shekels of silver.","26":"Then, as the king of Israel was passing by on the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, \u201cHelp, my lord, O king!\u201d","27":"And he said, \u201cIf the Lord does not help you, where can I find help for you? From the threshing floor or from the winepress?\u201d","28":"Then the king said to her, \u201cWhat is troubling you?\u201d And she answered, \u201cThis woman said to me, \u2018Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.\u2019","29":"So we boiled my son, and ate him. And I said to her on the next day, \u2018Give your son, that we may eat him\u2019; but she has hidden her son.\u201d","30":"Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the woman, that he tore his clothes; and as he passed by on the wall, the people looked, and there underneath he had sackcloth on his body.","31":"Then he said, \u201cGod do so to me and more also, if the head of Elisha the son of Shaphat remains on him today!\u201d","32":"But Elisha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. And the king sent a man ahead of him, but before the messenger came to him, he said to the elders, \u201cDo you see how this son of a murderer has sent someone to take away my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold him fast at the door. Is not the sound of his master\u2019s feet behind him?\u201d","33":"And while he was still talking with them, there was the messenger, coming down to him; and then the king said, \u201cSurely this calamity is from the Lord; why should I wait for the Lord any longer?\u201d"},"7":{"1":"Then Elisha said, \u201cHear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord: \u2018Tomorrow about this time a seah of fine flour shall be sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Samaria.\u2019 \u201d","2":"So an officer on whose hand the king leaned answered the man of God and said, \u201cLook, if the Lord would make windows in heaven, could this thing be?\u201d And he said, \u201cIn fact, you shall see it with your eyes, but you shall not eat of it.\u201d The Syrians Flee","3":"Now there were four leprous men at the entrance of the gate; and they said to one another, \u201cWhy are we sitting here until we die?","4":"If we say, \u2018We will enter the city,\u2019 the famine is in the city, and we shall die there. And if we sit here, we die also. Now therefore, come, let us surrender to the army of the Syrians. If they keep us alive, we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall only die.\u201d","5":"And they rose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians; and when they had come to the outskirts of the Syrian camp, to their surprise no one was there.","6":"For the Lord had caused the army of the Syrians to hear the noise of chariots and the noise of horses\u2014the noise of a great army; so they said to one another, \u201cLook, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of the Egyptians to attack us!\u201d","7":"Therefore they arose and fled at twilight, and left the camp intact\u2014their tents, their horses, and their donkeys\u2014and they fled for their lives.","8":"And when these lepers came to the outskirts of the camp, they went into one tent and ate and drank, and carried from it silver and gold and clothing, and went and hid them; then they came back and entered another tent, and carried some from there also, and went and hid it.","9":"Then they said to one another, \u201cWe are not doing right. This day is a day of good news, and we remain silent. If we wait until morning light, some punishment will come upon us. Now therefore, come, let us go and tell the king\u2019s household.\u201d","10":"So they went and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told them, saying, \u201cWe went to the Syrian camp, and surprisingly no one was there, not a human sound\u2014only horses and donkeys tied, and the tents intact.\u201d","11":"And the gatekeepers called out, and they told it to the king\u2019s household inside.","12":"So the king arose in the night and said to his servants, \u201cLet me now tell you what the Syrians have done to us. They know that we are hungry; therefore they have gone out of the camp to hide themselves in the field, saying, \u2018When they come out of the city, we shall catch them alive, and get into the city.\u2019 \u201d","13":"And one of his servants answered and said, \u201cPlease, let several men take five of the remaining horses which are left in the city. Look, they may either become like all the multitude of Israel that are left in it; or indeed, I say, they may become like all the multitude of Israel left from those who are consumed; so let us send them and see.\u201d","14":"Therefore they took two chariots with horses; and the king sent them in the direction of the Syrian army, saying, \u201cGo and see.\u201d","15":"And they went after them to the Jordan; and indeed all the road was full of garments and weapons which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. So the messengers returned and told the king.","16":"Then the people went out and plundered the tents of the Syrians. So a seah of fine flour was sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the Lord.","17":"Now the king had appointed the officer on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate.

Hilkiah Finds the Book of the Law","3":"Now it came to pass, in the eighteenth year of King Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the scribe, the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, to the house of the Lord, saying:","4":"\u201cGo up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may count the money which has been brought into the house of the Lord, which the doorkeepers have gathered from the people.","5":"And let them deliver it into the hand of those doing the work, who are the overseers in the house of the Lord; let them give it to those who are in the house of the Lord doing the work, to repair the damages of the house\u2014","6":"to carpenters and builders and masons\u2014and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.","7":"However there need be no accounting made with them of the money delivered into their hand, because they deal faithfully.\u201d","8":"Then Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, \u201cI have found the Book of the Law in the house of the Lord.\u201d And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.","9":"So Shaphan the scribe went to the king, bringing the king word, saying, \u201cYour servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of those who do the work, who oversee the house of the Lord.\u201d","10":"Then Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, \u201cHilkiah the priest has given me a book.\u201d And Shaphan read it before the king.","11":"Now it happened, when the king heard the words of the Book of the Law, that he tore his clothes.","12":"Then the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam the son of Shaphan, Achbor the son of Michaiah, Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah a servant of the king, saying,","13":"\u201cGo, inquire of the Lord for me, for the people and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found; for great is the wrath of the Lord that is aroused against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do according to all that is written concerning us.\u201d","14":"So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe.

And he read in their hearing all the words of the Book of the Covenant which had been found in the house of the Lord.","3":"Then the king stood by a pillar and made a covenant before the Lord, to follow the Lord and to keep His commandments and His testimonies and His statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of this covenant that were written in this book. And all the people took a stand for the covenant.","4":"And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the second order, and the doorkeepers, to bring out of the temple of the Lord all the articles that were made for Baal, for Asherah, and for all the host of heaven; and he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried their ashes to Bethel.","5":"Then he removed the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense on the high places in the cities of Judah and in the places all around Jerusalem, and those who burned incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations, and to all the host of heaven.","6":"And he brought out the wooden image from the house of the Lord, to the Brook Kidron outside Jerusalem, burned it at the Brook Kidron and ground it to ashes, and threw its ashes on the graves of the common people.","7":"Then he tore down the ritual booths of the perverted persons that were in the house of the Lord, where the women wove hangings for the wooden image.","8":"And he brought all the priests from the cities of Judah, and defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense, from Geba to Beersheba; also he broke down the high places at the gates which were at the entrance of the Gate of Joshua the governor of the city, which were to the left of the city gate.","9":"Nevertheless the priests of the high places did not come up to the altar of the Lord in Jerusalem, but they ate unleavened bread among their brethren.","10":"And he defiled Topheth, which is in the Valley of the Son of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter pass through the fire to Molech.","11":"Then he removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun, at the entrance to the house of the Lord, by the chamber of Nathan-Melech, the officer who was in the court; and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire.","12":"The altars that were on the roof, the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the Lord, the king broke down and pulverized there, and threw their dust into the Brook Kidron.","13":"Then the king defiled the high places that were east of Jerusalem, which were on the south of the Mount of Corruption, which Solomon king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Sidonians, for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the people of Ammon.","14":"And he broke in pieces the sacred pillars and cut down the wooden images, and filled their places with the bones of men.","15":"Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel sin, had made, both that altar and the high place he broke down; and he burned the high place and crushed it to powder, and burned the wooden image.","16":"As Josiah turned, he saw the tombs that were there on the mountain. And he sent and took the bones out of the tombs and burned them on the altar, and defiled it according to the word of the Lord which the man of God proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.","17":"Then he said, \u201cWhat gravestone is this that I see?\u201d So the men of the city told him, \u201cIt is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and proclaimed these things which you have done against the altar of Bethel.\u201d","18":"And he said, \u201cLet him alone; let no one move his bones.\u201d So they let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria.","19":"Now Josiah also took away all the shrines of the high places that were in the cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to provoke the Lord to anger; and he did to them according to all the deeds he had done in Bethel.","20":"He executed all the priests of the high places who were there, on the altars, and burned men\u2019s bones on them; and he returned to Jerusalem.","21":"Then the king commanded all the people, saying, \u201cKeep the Passover to the Lord your God, as it is written in this Book of the Covenant.\u201d","22":"Such a Passover surely had never been held since the days of the judges who judged Israel, nor in all the days of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah.","23":"But in the eighteenth year of King Josiah this Passover was held before the Lord in Jerusalem.","24":"Moreover Josiah put away those who consulted mediums and spiritists, the household gods and idols, all the abominations that were seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, that he might perform the words of the law which were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the house of the Lord.","25":"Now before him there was no king like him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his might, according to all the Law of Moses; nor after him did any arise like him. Impending Judgment on Judah","26":"Nevertheless the Lord did not turn from the fierceness of His great wrath, with which His anger was aroused against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him.","27":"And the Lord said, \u201cI will also remove Judah from My sight, as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said, \u2018My name shall be there.\u2019 \u201d Josiah Dies in Battle","28":"Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?","29":"In his days Pharaoh Necho king of Egypt went to the aid of the king of Assyria, to the River Euphrates; and King Josiah went against him.

Then Jehoiachin his son reigned in his place.","7":"And the king of Egypt did not come out of his land anymore, for the king of Babylon had taken all that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Brook of Egypt to the River Euphrates.
