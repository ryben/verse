Appoint a general against her; Cause the horses to come up like the bristling locusts.","28":"Prepare against her the nations, With the kings of the Medes, Its governors and all its rulers, All the land of his dominion.","29":"And the land will tremble and sorrow; For every purpose of the Lord shall be performed against Babylon, To make the land of Babylon a desolation without inhabitant.","30":"The mighty men of Babylon have ceased fighting, They have remained in their strongholds; Their might has failed, They became like women; They have burned her dwelling places, The bars of her gate are broken.","31":"One runner will run to meet another, And one messenger to meet another, To show the king of Babylon that his city is taken on all sides;","32":"The passages are blocked, The reeds they have burned with fire, And the men of war are terrified.","33":"For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: \u201cThe daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor When it is time to thresh her; Yet a little while And the time of her harvest will come.\u201d","34":"\u201cNebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon Has devoured me, he has crushed me; He has made me an empty vessel, He has swallowed me up like a monster; He has filled his stomach with my delicacies, He has spit me out.","35":"Let the violence done to me and my flesh be upon Babylon,\u201d The inhabitant of Zion will say; \u201cAnd my blood be upon the inhabitants of Chaldea!\u201d Jerusalem will say.","36":"Therefore thus says the Lord: \u201cBehold, I will plead your case and take vengeance for you. I will dry up her sea and make her springs dry.","37":"Babylon shall become a heap, A dwelling place for jackals, An astonishment and a hissing, Without an inhabitant.","38":"They shall roar together like lions, They shall growl like lions\u2019 whelps.","39":"In their excitement I will prepare their feasts; I will make them drunk, That they may rejoice, And sleep a perpetual sleep And not awake,\u201d says the Lord.","40":"\u201cI will bring them down Like lambs to the slaughter, Like rams with male goats.","41":"\u201cOh, how Sheshach is taken! Oh, how the praise of the whole earth is seized! How Babylon has become desolate among the nations!","42":"The sea has come up over Babylon; She is covered with the multitude of its waves.","43":"Her cities are a desolation, A dry land and a wilderness, A land where no one dwells, Through which no son of man passes.","44":"I will punish Bel in Babylon, And I will bring out of his mouth what he has swallowed; And the nations shall not stream to him anymore. Yes, the wall of Babylon shall fall.","45":"\u201cMy people, go out of the midst of her! And let everyone deliver himself from the fierce anger of the Lord.","46":"And lest your heart faint, And you fear for the rumor that will be heard in the land (A rumor will come one year, And after that, in another year A rumor will come, And violence in the land, Ruler against ruler),","47":"Therefore behold, the days are coming That I will bring judgment on the carved images of Babylon; Her whole land shall be ashamed, And all her slain shall fall in her midst.","48":"Then the heavens and the earth and all that is in them Shall sing joyously over Babylon; For the plunderers shall come to her from the north,\u201d says the Lord.","49":"As Babylon has caused the slain of Israel to fall, So at Babylon the slain of all the earth shall fall.","50":"You who have escaped the sword, Get away! Do not stand still! Remember the Lord afar off, And let Jerusalem come to your mind.","51":"We are ashamed because we have heard reproach. Shame has covered our faces, For strangers have come into the sanctuaries of the Lord\u2019s house.","52":"\u201cTherefore behold, the days are coming,\u201d says the Lord, \u201cThat I will bring judgment on her carved images, And throughout all her land the wounded shall groan.","53":"Though Babylon were to mount up to heaven, And though she were to fortify the height of her strength, Yet from Me plunderers would come to her,\u201d says the Lord.","54":"The sound of a cry comes from Babylon, And great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans,","55":"Because the Lord is plundering Babylon And silencing her loud voice, Though her waves roar like great waters, And the noise of their voice is uttered,","56":"Because the plunderer comes against her, against Babylon, And her mighty men are taken. Every one of their bows is broken; For the Lord is the God of recompense, He will surely repay.","57":"\u201cAnd I will make drunk Her princes and wise men, Her governors, her deputies, and her mighty men. And they shall sleep a perpetual sleep And not awake,\u201d says the King, Whose name is the Lord of hosts.","58":"Thus says the Lord of hosts: \u201cThe broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, And her high gates shall be burned with fire; The people will labor in vain, And the nations, because of the fire; And they shall be weary.\u201d Jeremiah\u2019s Command to Seraiah","59":"The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And Seraiah was the quartermaster.","60":"So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that would come upon Babylon, all these words that are written against Babylon.","61":"And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, \u201cWhen you arrive in Babylon and see it, and read all these words,","62":"then you shall say, \u2018O Lord, You have spoken against this place to cut it off, so that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but it shall be desolate forever.\u2019","63":"Now it shall be, when you have finished reading this book, that you shall tie a stone to it and throw it out into the Euphrates.","64":"Then you shall say, \u2018Thus Babylon shall sink and not rise from the catastrophe that I will bring upon her. And they shall be weary.\u2019 \u201d Thus far are the words of Jeremiah."},"52":{"1":"Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother\u2019s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.","2":"He also did evil in the sight of the Lord, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.","3":"For because of the anger of the Lord this happened in Jerusalem and Judah, till He finally cast them out from His presence. Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.","4":"Now it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came against Jerusalem and encamped against it; and they built a siege wall against it all around.","5":"So the city was besieged until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah.","6":"By the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the famine had become so severe in the city that there was no food for the people of the land.","7":"Then the city wall was broken through, and all the men of war fled and went out of the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king\u2019s garden, even though the Chaldeans were near the city all around. And they went by way of the plain.","8":"But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and they overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho. All his army was scattered from him.","9":"So they took the king and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he pronounced judgment on him.","10":"Then the king of Babylon killed the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes. And he killed all the princes of Judah in Riblah.","11":"He also put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in bronze fetters, took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death. The Temple and City Plundered and Burned","12":"Now in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month (which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem.","13":"He burned the house of the Lord and the king\u2019s house; all the houses of Jerusalem, that is, all the houses of the great, he burned with fire.","14":"And all the army of the Chaldeans who were with the captain of the guard broke down all the walls of Jerusalem all around.","15":"Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poor people, the rest of the people who remained in the city, the defectors who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen.","16":"But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left some of the poor of the land as vinedressers and farmers.","17":"The bronze pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the carts and the bronze Sea that were in the house of the Lord, the Chaldeans broke in pieces, and carried all their bronze to Babylon.","18":"They also took away the pots, the shovels, the trimmers, the bowls, the spoons, and all the bronze utensils with which the priests ministered.","19":"The basins, the firepans, the bowls, the pots, the lampstands, the spoons, and the cups, whatever was solid gold and whatever was solid silver, the captain of the guard took away.","20":"The two pillars, one Sea, the twelve bronze bulls which were under it, and the carts, which King Solomon had made for the house of the Lord\u2014the bronze of all these articles was beyond measure.","21":"Now concerning the pillars: the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits, a measuring line of twelve cubits could measure its circumference, and its thickness was four fingers; it was hollow.","22":"A capital of bronze was on it; and the height of one capital was five cubits, with a network and pomegranates all around the capital, all of bronze. The second pillar, with pomegranates was the same.","23":"There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates, all around on the network, were one hundred. The People Taken Captive to Babylonia","24":"The captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, and the three doorkeepers.","25":"He also took out of the city an officer who had charge of the men of war, seven men of the king\u2019s close associates who were found in the city, the principal scribe of the army who mustered the people of the land, and sixty men of the people of the land who were found in the midst of the city.","26":"And Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took these and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.","27":"Then the king of Babylon struck them and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive from its own land.","28":"These are the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews;","29":"in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;","30":"in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons. All the persons were four thousand six hundred. Jehoiachin Released from Prison","31":"Now it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, that Evil-Merodach king of Babylon, in the first year of his reign, lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah and brought him out of prison.","32":"And he spoke kindly to him and gave him a more prominent seat than those of the kings who were with him in Babylon.","33":"So Jehoiachin changed from his prison garments, and he ate bread regularly before the king all the days of his life.","34":"And as for his provisions, there was a regular ration given him by the king of Babylon, a portion for each day until the day of his death, all the days of his life."}}
