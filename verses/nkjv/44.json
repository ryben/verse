At Antioch in Pisidia","13":"Now when Paul and his party set sail from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.","14":"But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day and sat down.","15":"And after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, \u201cMen and brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.\u201d","16":"Then Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said, \u201cMen of Israel, and you who fear God, listen:","17":"The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm He brought them out of it.","18":"Now for a time of about forty years He put up with their ways in the wilderness.","19":"And when He had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He distributed their land to them by allotment.","20":"\u201cAfter that He gave them judges for about four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.","21":"And afterward they asked for a king; so God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.","22":"And when He had removed him, He raised up for them David as king, to whom also He gave testimony and said, \u2018I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, who will do all My will.\u2019","23":"From this man\u2019s seed, according to the promise, God raised up for Israel a Savior\u2014Jesus\u2014","24":"after John had first preached, before His coming, the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.","25":"And as John was finishing his course, he said, \u2018Who do you think I am? I am not He. But behold, there comes One after me, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.\u2019","26":"\u201cMen and brethren, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you the word of this salvation has been sent.","27":"For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they did not know Him, nor even the voices of the Prophets which are read every Sabbath, have fulfilled them in condemning Him.","28":"And though they found no cause for death in Him, they asked Pilate that He should be put to death.","29":"Now when they had fulfilled all that was written concerning Him, they took Him down from the tree and laid Him in a tomb.","30":"But God raised Him from the dead.","31":"He was seen for many days by those who came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses to the people.","32":"And we declare to you glad tidings\u2014that promise which was made to the fathers.","33":"God has fulfilled this for us their children, in that He has raised up Jesus. As it is also written in the second Psalm: \u2018You are My Son, Today I have begotten You.\u2019","34":"And that He raised Him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, He has spoken thus: \u2018I will give you the sure mercies of David.\u2019","35":"Therefore He also says in another Psalm: \u2018You will not allow Your Holy One to see corruption.\u2019","36":"\u201cFor David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, was buried with his fathers, and saw corruption;","37":"but He whom God raised up saw no corruption.","38":"Therefore let it be known to you, brethren, that through this Man is preached to you the forgiveness of sins;","39":"and by Him everyone who believes is justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.","40":"Beware therefore, lest what has been spoken in the prophets come upon you:","41":"\u2018Behold, you despisers, Marvel and perish! For I work a work in your days, A work which you will by no means believe, Though one were to declare it to you.\u2019 \u201d Blessing and Conflict at Antioch","42":"So when the Jews went out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath.","43":"Now when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.","44":"On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God.","45":"But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy; and contradicting and blaspheming, they opposed the things spoken by Paul.","46":"Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold and said, \u201cIt was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first; but since you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.","47":"For so the Lord has commanded us: \u2018I have set you as a light to the Gentiles, That you should be for salvation to the ends of the earth.\u2019 \u201d","48":"Now when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord. And as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed.","49":"And the word of the Lord was being spread throughout all the region.","50":"But the Jews stirred up the devout and prominent women and the chief men of the city, raised up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them from their region.","51":"But they shook off the dust from their feet against them, and came to Iconium.","52":"And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit."},"14":{"1":"Now it happened in Iconium that they went together to the synagogue of the Jews, and so spoke that a great multitude both of the Jews and of the Greeks believed.","2":"But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brethren.","3":"Therefore they stayed there a long time, speaking boldly in the Lord, who was bearing witness to the word of His grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.","4":"But the multitude of the city was divided: part sided with the Jews, and part with the apostles.","5":"And when a violent attempt was made by both the Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to abuse and stone them,","6":"they became aware of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding region.","7":"And they were preaching the gospel there. Idolatry at Lystra","8":"And in Lystra a certain man without strength in his feet was sitting, a cripple from his mother\u2019s womb, who had never walked.","9":"This man heard Paul speaking. Paul, observing him intently and seeing that he had faith to be healed,","10":"said with a loud voice, \u201cStand up straight on your feet!\u201d And he leaped and walked.","11":"Now when the people saw what Paul had done, they raised their voices, saying in the Lycaonian language, \u201cThe gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!\u201d","12":"And Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.","13":"Then the priest of Zeus, whose temple was in front of their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, intending to sacrifice with the multitudes.","14":"But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard this, they tore their clothes and ran in among the multitude, crying out","15":"and saying, \u201cMen, why are you doing these things? We also are men with the same nature as you, and preach to you that you should turn from these useless things to the living God, who made the heaven, the earth, the sea, and all things that are in them,","16":"who in bygone generations allowed all nations to walk in their own ways.","17":"Nevertheless He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good, gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.\u201d","18":"And with these sayings they could scarcely restrain the multitudes from sacrificing to them. Stoning, Escape to Derbe","19":"Then Jews from Antioch and Iconium came there; and having persuaded the multitudes, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing him to be dead.","20":"However, when the disciples gathered around him, he rose up and went into the city. And the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe. Strengthening the Converts","21":"And when they had preached the gospel to that city and made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,","22":"strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, \u201cWe must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.\u201d","23":"So when they had appointed elders in every church, and prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.","24":"And after they had passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.","25":"Now when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.","26":"From there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed.","27":"Now when they had come and gathered the church together, they reported all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.","28":"So they stayed there a long time with the disciples."},"15":{"1":"And certain men came down from Judea and taught the brethren, \u201cUnless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.\u201d","2":"Therefore, when Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and dispute with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certain others of them should go up to Jerusalem, to the apostles and elders, about this question.","3":"So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brethren.","4":"And when they had come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they reported all things that God had done with them.","5":"But some of the sect of the Pharisees who believed rose up, saying, \u201cIt is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.\u201d The Jerusalem Council","6":"Now the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter.","7":"And when there had been much dispute, Peter rose up and said to them: \u201cMen and brethren, you know that a good while ago God chose among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.","8":"So God, who knows the heart, acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us,","9":"and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.","10":"Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke on the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?","11":"But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved in the same manner as they.\u201d","12":"Then all the multitude kept silent and listened to Barnabas and Paul declaring how many miracles and wonders God had worked through them among the Gentiles.","13":"And after they had become silent, James answered, saying, \u201cMen and brethren, listen to me:","14":"Simon has declared how God at the first visited the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name.","15":"And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:","16":"\u2018After this I will return And will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which has fallen down; I will rebuild its ruins, And I will set it up;","17":"So that the rest of mankind may seek the Lord, Even all the Gentiles who are called by My name, Says the Lord who does all these things.\u2019","18":"\u201cKnown to God from eternity are all His works.","19":"Therefore I judge that we should not trouble those from among the Gentiles who are turning to God,","20":"but that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from things strangled, and from blood.","21":"For Moses has had throughout many generations those who preach him in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath.\u201d The Jerusalem Decree","22":"Then it pleased the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas who was also named Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren.","23":"They wrote this letter by them: The apostles, the elders, and the brethren, To the brethren who are of the Gentiles in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia: Greetings.","24":"Since we have heard that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, \u201cYou must be circumcised and keep the law\u201d \u2014to whom we gave no such commandment\u2014","25":"it seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,","26":"men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.","27":"We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also report the same things by word of mouth.","28":"For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:","29":"that you abstain from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell. Continuing Ministry in Syria","30":"So when they were sent off, they came to Antioch; and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.","31":"When they had read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement.","32":"Now Judas and Silas, themselves being prophets also, exhorted and strengthened the brethren with many words.","33":"And after they had stayed there for a time, they were sent back with greetings from the brethren to the apostles.","34":"However, it seemed good to Silas to remain there.","35":"Paul and Barnabas also remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. Division over John Mark","36":"Then after some days Paul said to Barnabas, \u201cLet us now go back and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, and see how they are doing.\u201d","37":"Now Barnabas was determined to take with them John called Mark.","38":"But Paul insisted that they should not take with them the one who had departed from them in Pamphylia, and had not gone with them to the work.","39":"Then the contention became so sharp that they parted from one another. And so Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus;","40":"but Paul chose Silas and departed, being commended by the brethren to the grace of God.","41":"And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches."},"16":{"1":"Then he came to Derbe and Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain Jewish woman who believed, but his father was Greek.","2":"He was well spoken of by the brethren who were at Lystra and Iconium.","3":"Paul wanted to have him go on with him. And he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in that region, for they all knew that his father was Greek.","4":"And as they went through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep, which were determined by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.","5":"So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily. The Macedonian Call","6":"Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia.","7":"After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them.","8":"So passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.","9":"And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. A man of Macedonia stood and pleaded with him, saying, \u201cCome over to Macedonia and help us.\u201d","10":"Now after he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them. Lydia Baptized at Philippi","11":"Therefore, sailing from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day came to Neapolis,","12":"and from there to Philippi, which is the foremost city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were staying in that city for some days.","13":"And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily made; and we sat down and spoke to the women who met there.","14":"Now a certain woman named Lydia heard us. She was a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, who worshiped God. The Lord opened her heart to heed the things spoken by Paul.","15":"And when she and her household were baptized, she begged us, saying, \u201cIf you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay.\u201d So she persuaded us. Paul and Silas Imprisoned","16":"Now it happened, as we went to prayer, that a certain slave girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling.","17":"This girl followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying, \u201cThese men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.\u201d","18":"And this she did for many days. But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, \u201cI command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.\u201d And he came out that very hour.","19":"But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to the authorities.","20":"And they brought them to the magistrates, and said, \u201cThese men, being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city;","21":"and they teach customs which are not lawful for us, being Romans, to receive or observe.\u201d","22":"Then the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded them to be beaten with rods.","23":"And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely.","24":"Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. The Philippian Jailer Saved","25":"But at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.","26":"Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone\u2019s chains were loosed.","27":"And the keeper of the prison, awaking from sleep and seeing the prison doors open, supposing the prisoners had fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself.","28":"But Paul called with a loud voice, saying, \u201cDo yourself no harm, for we are all here.\u201d","29":"Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.","30":"And he brought them out and said, \u201cSirs, what must I do to be saved?\u201d","31":"So they said, \u201cBelieve on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.\u201d","32":"Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.","33":"And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes. And immediately he and all his family were baptized.","34":"Now when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them; and he rejoiced, having believed in God with all his household. Paul Refuses to Depart Secretly","35":"And when it was day, the magistrates sent the officers, saying, \u201cLet those men go.\u201d","36":"So the keeper of the prison reported these words to Paul, saying, \u201cThe magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace.\u201d","37":"But Paul said to them, \u201cThey have beaten us openly, uncondemned Romans, and have thrown us into prison. And now do they put us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and get us out.\u201d","38":"And the officers told these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.","39":"Then they came and pleaded with them and brought them out, and asked them to depart from the city.","40":"So they went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they encouraged them and departed."},"17":{"1":"Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.","2":"Then Paul, as his custom was, went in to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,","3":"explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, \u201cThis Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.\u201d","4":"And some of them were persuaded; and a great multitude of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the leading women, joined Paul and Silas. Assault on Jason\u2019s House","5":"But the Jews who were not persuaded, becoming envious, took some of the evil men from the marketplace, and gathering a mob, set all the city in an uproar and attacked the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.","6":"But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brethren to the rulers of the city, crying out, \u201cThese who have turned the world upside down have come here too.","7":"Jason has harbored them, and these are all acting contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king\u2014Jesus.\u201d","8":"And they troubled the crowd and the rulers of the city when they heard these things.","9":"So when they had taken security from Jason and the rest, they let them go. Ministering at Berea","10":"Then the brethren immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.","11":"These were more fair-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness, and searched the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.","12":"Therefore many of them believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, prominent women as well as men.","13":"But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came there also and stirred up the crowds.","14":"Then immediately the brethren sent Paul away, to go to the sea; but both Silas and Timothy remained there.","15":"So those who conducted Paul brought him to Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed. The Philosophers at Athens","16":"Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was given over to idols.","17":"Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with the Gentile worshipers, and in the marketplace daily with those who happened to be there.","18":"Then certain Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, \u201cWhat does this babbler want to say?\u201d Others said, \u201cHe seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods,\u201d because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.","19":"And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, \u201cMay we know what this new doctrine is of which you speak?","20":"For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean.\u201d","21":"For all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing. Addressing the Areopagus","22":"Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, \u201cMen of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious;","23":"for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship, I even found an altar with this inscription: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you:","24":"\u201cGod, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands.","25":"Nor is He worshiped with men\u2019s hands, as though He needed anything, since He gives to all life, breath, and all things.","26":"And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings,","27":"so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us;","28":"for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, \u2018For we are also His offspring.\u2019","29":"Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and man\u2019s devising.","30":"Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent,","31":"because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.\u201d","32":"And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, while others said, \u201cWe will hear you again on this matter. \u201d","33":"So Paul departed from among them.","34":"However, some men joined him and believed, among them Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them."},"18":{"1":"After these things Paul departed from Athens and went to Corinth.","2":"And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla (because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome); and he came to them.","3":"So, because he was of the same trade, he stayed with them and worked; for by occupation they were tentmakers.","4":"And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.","5":"When Silas and Timothy had come from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.","6":"But when they opposed him and blasphemed, he shook his garments and said to them, \u201cYour blood be upon your own heads; I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.\u201d","7":"And he departed from there and entered the house of a certain man named Justus, one who worshiped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.","8":"Then Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his household. And many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed and were baptized.","9":"Now the Lord spoke to Paul in the night by a vision, \u201cDo not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent;","10":"for I am with you, and no one will attack you to hurt you; for I have many people in this city.\u201d","11":"And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.","12":"When Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord rose up against Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,","13":"saying, \u201cThis fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.\u201d","14":"And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, \u201cIf it were a matter of wrongdoing or wicked crimes, O Jews, there would be reason why I should bear with you.","15":"But if it is a question of words and names and your own law, look to it yourselves; for I do not want to be a judge of such matters. \u201d","16":"And he drove them from the judgment seat.","17":"Then all the Greeks took Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the judgment seat. But Gallio took no notice of these things. Paul Returns to Antioch","18":"So Paul still remained a good while. Then he took leave of the brethren and sailed for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila were with him. He had his hair cut off at Cenchrea, for he had taken a vow.","19":"And he came to Ephesus, and left them there; but he himself entered the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.","20":"When they asked him to stay a longer time with them, he did not consent,","21":"but took leave of them, saying, \u201cI must by all means keep this coming feast in Jerusalem; but I will return again to you, God willing.\u201d And he sailed from Ephesus.","22":"And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.","23":"After he had spent some time there, he departed and went over the region of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples. Ministry of Apollos","24":"Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus.","25":"This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things of the Lord, though he knew only the baptism of John.","26":"So he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.","27":"And when he desired to cross to Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; and when he arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace;","28":"for he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ."},"19":{"1":"And it happened, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed through the upper regions, came to Ephesus. And finding some disciples","2":"he said to them, \u201cDid you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?\u201d So they said to him, \u201cWe have not so much as heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.\u201d","3":"And he said to them, \u201cInto what then were you baptized?\u201d So they said, \u201cInto John\u2019s baptism.\u201d","4":"Then Paul said, \u201cJohn indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on Him who would come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.\u201d","5":"When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.","6":"And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.","7":"Now the men were about twelve in all.","8":"And he went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading concerning the things of the kingdom of God.","9":"But when some were hardened and did not believe, but spoke evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them and withdrew the disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.","10":"And this continued for two years, so that all who dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks. Miracles Glorify Christ","11":"Now God worked unusual miracles by the hands of Paul,","12":"so that even handkerchiefs or aprons were brought from his body to the sick, and the diseases left them and the evil spirits went out of them.","13":"Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, \u201cWe exorcise you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.\u201d","14":"Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so.","15":"And the evil spirit answered and said, \u201cJesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?\u201d","16":"Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.","17":"This became known both to all Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.","18":"And many who had believed came confessing and telling their deeds.","19":"Also, many of those who had practiced magic brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted up the value of them, and it totaled fifty thousand pieces of silver.","20":"So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed. The Riot at Ephesus","21":"When these things were accomplished, Paul purposed in the Spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, \u201cAfter I have been there, I must also see Rome.\u201d","22":"So he sent into Macedonia two of those who ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, but he himself stayed in Asia for a time.","23":"And about that time there arose a great commotion about the Way.","24":"For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Diana, brought no small profit to the craftsmen.","25":"He called them together with the workers of similar occupation, and said: \u201cMen, you know that we have our prosperity by this trade.","26":"Moreover you see and hear that not only at Ephesus, but throughout almost all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are not gods which are made with hands.","27":"So not only is this trade of ours in danger of falling into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Diana may be despised and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.\u201d","28":"Now when they heard this, they were full of wrath and cried out, saying, \u201cGreat is Diana of the Ephesians!\u201d","29":"So the whole city was filled with confusion, and rushed into the theater with one accord, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul\u2019s travel companions.","30":"And when Paul wanted to go in to the people, the disciples would not allow him.","31":"Then some of the officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him pleading that he would not venture into the theater.","32":"Some therefore cried one thing and some another, for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together.","33":"And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, and wanted to make his defense to the people.","34":"But when they found out that he was a Jew, all with one voice cried out for about two hours, \u201cGreat is Diana of the Ephesians!\u201d","35":"And when the city clerk had quieted the crowd, he said: \u201cMen of Ephesus, what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple guardian of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Zeus?","36":"Therefore, since these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rashly.","37":"For you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess.","38":"Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a case against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.","39":"But if you have any other inquiry to make, it shall be determined in the lawful assembly.","40":"For we are in danger of being called in question for today\u2019s uproar, there being no reason which we may give to account for this disorderly gathering.\u201d","41":"And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly."},"20":{"1":"After the uproar had ceased, Paul called the disciples to himself, embraced them, and departed to go to Macedonia.","2":"Now when he had gone over that region and encouraged them with many words, he came to Greece","3":"and stayed three months. And when the Jews plotted against him as he was about to sail to Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.","4":"And Sopater of Berea accompanied him to Asia\u2014also Aristarchus and Secundus of the Thessalonians, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus of Asia.","5":"These men, going ahead, waited for us at Troas.","6":"But we sailed away from Philippi after the Days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days joined them at Troas, where we stayed seven days. Ministering at Troas","7":"Now on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul, ready to depart the next day, spoke to them and continued his message until midnight.","8":"There were many lamps in the upper room where they were gathered together.","9":"And in a window sat a certain young man named Eutychus, who was sinking into a deep sleep. He was overcome by sleep; and as Paul continued speaking, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.","10":"But Paul went down, fell on him, and embracing him said, \u201cDo not trouble yourselves, for his life is in him.\u201d","11":"Now when he had come up, had broken bread and eaten, and talked a long while, even till daybreak, he departed.","12":"And they brought the young man in alive, and they were not a little comforted. From Troas to Miletus","13":"Then we went ahead to the ship and sailed to Assos, there intending to take Paul on board; for so he had given orders, intending himself to go on foot.","14":"And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.","15":"We sailed from there, and the next day came opposite Chios. The following day we arrived at Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The next day we came to Miletus.","16":"For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he would not have to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the Day of Pentecost. The Ephesian Elders Exhorted","17":"From Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called for the elders of the church.","18":"And when they had come to him, he said to them: \u201cYou know, from the first day that I came to Asia, in what manner I always lived among you,","19":"serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears and trials which happened to me by the plotting of the Jews;","20":"how I kept back nothing that was helpful, but proclaimed it to you, and taught you publicly and from house to house,","21":"testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.","22":"And see, now I go bound in the spirit to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there,","23":"except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that chains and tribulations await me.","24":"But none of these things move me; nor do I count my life dear to myself, so that I may finish my race with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.","25":"\u201cAnd indeed, now I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more.","26":"Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all men.","27":"For I have not shunned to declare to you the whole counsel of God.","28":"Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to shepherd the church of God which He purchased with His own blood.","29":"For I know this, that after my departure savage wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock.","30":"Also from among yourselves men will rise up, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after themselves.","31":"Therefore watch, and remember that for three years I did not cease to warn everyone night and day with tears.","32":"\u201cSo now, brethren, I commend you to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who are sanctified.","33":"I have coveted no one\u2019s silver or gold or apparel.","34":"Yes, you yourselves know that these hands have provided for my necessities, and for those who were with me.","35":"I have shown you in every way, by laboring like this, that you must support the weak. And remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, \u2018It is more blessed to give than to receive.\u2019 \u201d","36":"And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.","37":"Then they all wept freely, and fell on Paul\u2019s neck and kissed him,","38":"sorrowing most of all for the words which he spoke, that they would see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship."},"21":{"1":"Now it came to pass, that when we had departed from them and set sail, running a straight course we came to Cos, the following day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.","2":"And finding a ship sailing over to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.","3":"When we had sighted Cyprus, we passed it on the left, sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo.","4":"And finding disciples, we stayed there seven days. They told Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.","5":"When we had come to the end of those days, we departed and went on our way; and they all accompanied us, with wives and children, till we were out of the city. And we knelt down on the shore and prayed.","6":"When we had taken our leave of one another, we boarded the ship, and they returned home.","7":"And when we had finished our voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, greeted the brethren, and stayed with them one day.","8":"On the next day we who were Paul\u2019s companions departed and came to Caesarea, and entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.","9":"Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.","10":"And as we stayed many days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.","11":"When he had come to us, he took Paul\u2019s belt, bound his own hands and feet, and said, \u201cThus says the Holy Spirit, \u2018So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man who owns this belt, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.\u2019 \u201d","12":"Now when we heard these things, both we and those from that place pleaded with him not to go up to Jerusalem.","13":"Then Paul answered, \u201cWhat do you mean by weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.\u201d","14":"So when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, \u201cThe will of the Lord be done.\u201d Paul Urged to Make Peace","15":"And after those days we packed and went up to Jerusalem.","16":"Also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us and brought with them a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we were to lodge.","17":"And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.","18":"On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.","19":"When he had greeted them, he told in detail those things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.","20":"And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord. And they said to him, \u201cYou see, brother, how many myriads of Jews there are who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law;","21":"but they have been informed about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children nor to walk according to the customs.","22":"What then? The assembly must certainly meet, for they will hear that you have come.","23":"Therefore do what we tell you: We have four men who have taken a vow.","24":"Take them and be purified with them, and pay their expenses so that they may shave their heads, and that all may know that those things of which they were informed concerning you are nothing, but that you yourself also walk orderly and keep the law.","25":"But concerning the Gentiles who believe, we have written and decided that they should observe no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from things offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from sexual immorality.\u201d Arrested in the Temple","26":"Then Paul took the men, and the next day, having been purified with them, entered the temple to announce the expiration of the days of purification, at which time an offering should be made for each one of them.","27":"Now when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,","28":"crying out, \u201cMen of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, the law, and this place; and furthermore he also brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.\u201d","29":"(For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)","30":"And all the city was disturbed; and the people ran together, seized Paul, and dragged him out of the temple; and immediately the doors were shut.","31":"Now as they were seeking to kill him, news came to the commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.","32":"He immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down to them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.","33":"Then the commander came near and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and he asked who he was and what he had done.","34":"And some among the multitude cried one thing and some another. So when he could not ascertain the truth because of the tumult, he commanded him to be taken into the barracks.","35":"When he reached the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob.","36":"For the multitude of the people followed after, crying out, \u201cAway with him!\u201d Addressing the Jerusalem Mob","37":"Then as Paul was about to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, \u201cMay I speak to you?\u201d He replied, \u201cCan you speak Greek?","38":"Are you not the Egyptian who some time ago stirred up a rebellion and led the four thousand assassins out into the wilderness?\u201d","39":"But Paul said, \u201cI am a Jew from Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city; and I implore you, permit me to speak to the people.\u201d","40":"So when he had given him permission, Paul stood on the stairs and motioned with his hand to the people.

Then he said:","3":"\u201cI am indeed a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, taught according to the strictness of our fathers\u2019 law, and was zealous toward God as you all are today.","4":"I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women,","5":"as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the council of the elders, from whom I also received letters to the brethren, and went to Damascus to bring in chains even those who were there to Jerusalem to be punished.","6":"\u201cNow it happened, as I journeyed and came near Damascus at about noon, suddenly a great light from heaven shone around me.","7":"And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, \u2018Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?\u2019","8":"So I answered, \u2018Who are You, Lord?\u2019 And He said to me, \u2018I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.\u2019","9":"\u201cAnd those who were with me indeed saw the light and were afraid, but they did not hear the voice of Him who spoke to me.","10":"So I said, \u2018What shall I do, Lord?\u2019 And the Lord said to me, \u2018Arise and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all things which are appointed for you to do.\u2019","11":"And since I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came into Damascus.","12":"\u201cThen a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good testimony with all the Jews who dwelt there,","13":"came to me; and he stood and said to me, \u2018Brother Saul, receive your sight.\u2019 And at that same hour I looked up at him.","14":"Then he said, \u2018The God of our fathers has chosen you that you should know His will, and see the Just One, and hear the voice of His mouth.","15":"For you will be His witness to all men of what you have seen and heard.","16":"And now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.\u2019","17":"\u201cNow it happened, when I returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, that I was in a trance","18":"and saw Him saying to me, \u2018Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, for they will not receive your testimony concerning Me.\u2019","19":"So I said, \u2018Lord, they know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believe on You.","20":"And when the blood of Your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by consenting to his death, and guarding the clothes of those who were killing him.\u2019","21":"Then He said to me, \u2018Depart, for I will send you far from here to the Gentiles.\u2019 \u201d Paul\u2019s Roman Citizenship","22":"And they listened to him until this word, and then they raised their voices and said, \u201cAway with such a fellow from the earth, for he is not fit to live!\u201d","23":"Then, as they cried out and tore off their clothes and threw dust into the air,","24":"the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and said that he should be examined under scourging, so that he might know why they shouted so against him.","25":"And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, \u201cIs it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?\u201d","26":"When the centurion heard that, he went and told the commander, saying, \u201cTake care what you do, for this man is a Roman.\u201d","27":"Then the commander came and said to him, \u201cTell me, are you a Roman?\u201d He said, \u201cYes.\u201d","28":"The commander answered, \u201cWith a large sum I obtained this citizenship.\u201d And Paul said, \u201cBut I was born a citizen. \u201d","29":"Then immediately those who were about to examine him withdrew from him; and the commander was also afraid after he found out that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him. The Sanhedrin Divided","30":"The next day, because he wanted to know for certain why he was accused by the Jews, he released him from his bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down and set him before them."},"23":{"1":"Then Paul, looking earnestly at the council, said, \u201cMen and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.\u201d","2":"And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.","3":"Then Paul said to him, \u201cGod will strike you, you whitewashed wall! For you sit to judge me according to the law, and do you command me to be struck contrary to the law?\u201d","4":"And those who stood by said, \u201cDo you revile God\u2019s high priest?\u201d","5":"Then Paul said, \u201cI did not know, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, \u2018You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.\u2019 \u201d","6":"But when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, \u201cMen and brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!\u201d","7":"And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the assembly was divided.","8":"For Sadducees say that there is no resurrection\u2014and no angel or spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.","9":"Then there arose a loud outcry. And the scribes of the Pharisees\u2019 party arose and protested, saying, \u201cWe find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.\u201d","10":"Now when there arose a great dissension, the commander, fearing lest Paul might be pulled to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him by force from among them, and bring him into the barracks. The Plot Against Paul","11":"But the following night the Lord stood by him and said, \u201cBe of good cheer, Paul; for as you have testified for Me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness at Rome.\u201d","12":"And when it was day, some of the Jews banded together and bound themselves under an oath, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.","13":"Now there were more than forty who had formed this conspiracy.","14":"They came to the chief priests and elders, and said, \u201cWe have bound ourselves under a great oath that we will eat nothing until we have killed Paul.","15":"Now you, therefore, together with the council, suggest to the commander that he be brought down to you tomorrow, as though you were going to make further inquiries concerning him; but we are ready to kill him before he comes near.\u201d","16":"So when Paul\u2019s sister\u2019s son heard of their ambush, he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.","17":"Then Paul called one of the centurions to him and said, \u201cTake this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him.\u201d","18":"So he took him and brought him to the commander and said, \u201cPaul the prisoner called me to him and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to say to you.\u201d","19":"Then the commander took him by the hand, went aside, and asked privately, \u201cWhat is it that you have to tell me?\u201d","20":"And he said, \u201cThe Jews have agreed to ask that you bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire more fully about him.","21":"But do not yield to them, for more than forty of them lie in wait for him, men who have bound themselves by an oath that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him; and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.\u201d","22":"So the commander let the young man depart, and commanded him, \u201cTell no one that you have revealed these things to me.\u201d Sent to Felix","23":"And he called for two centurions, saying, \u201cPrepare two hundred soldiers, seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen to go to Caesarea at the third hour of the night;","24":"and provide mounts to set Paul on, and bring him safely to Felix the governor.\u201d","25":"He wrote a letter in the following manner:","26":"Claudius Lysias, To the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.","27":"This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them.

Farewell.","31":"Then the soldiers, as they were commanded, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.","32":"The next day they left the horsemen to go on with him, and returned to the barracks.","33":"When they came to Caesarea and had delivered the letter to the governor, they also presented Paul to him.","34":"And when the governor had read it, he asked what province he was from. And when he understood that he was from Cilicia,","35":"he said, \u201cI will hear you when your accusers also have come.\u201d And he commanded him to be kept in Herod\u2019s Praetorium."},"24":{"1":"Now after five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders and a certain orator named Tertullus.

By examining him yourself you may ascertain all these things of which we accuse him.\u201d","9":"And the Jews also assented, maintaining that these things were so. The Defense Before Felix","10":"Then Paul, after the governor had nodded to him to speak, answered: \u201cInasmuch as I know that you have been for many years a judge of this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself,","11":"because you may ascertain that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.","12":"And they neither found me in the temple disputing with anyone nor inciting the crowd, either in the synagogues or in the city.","13":"Nor can they prove the things of which they now accuse me.","14":"But this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets.","15":"I have hope in God, which they themselves also accept, that there will be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust.","16":"This being so, I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men.","17":"\u201cNow after many years I came to bring alms and offerings to my nation,","18":"in the midst of which some Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with a mob nor with tumult.","19":"They ought to have been here before you to object if they had anything against me.","20":"Or else let those who are here themselves say if they found any wrongdoing in me while I stood before the council,","21":"unless it is for this one statement which I cried out, standing among them, \u2018Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you this day.\u2019 \u201d Felix Procrastinates","22":"But when Felix heard these things, having more accurate knowledge of the Way, he adjourned the proceedings and said, \u201cWhen Lysias the commander comes down, I will make a decision on your case.\u201d","23":"So he commanded the centurion to keep Paul and to let him have liberty, and told him not to forbid any of his friends to provide for or visit him.","24":"And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.","25":"Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix was afraid and answered, \u201cGo away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you.\u201d","26":"Meanwhile he also hoped that money would be given him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore he sent for him more often and conversed with him.","27":"But after two years Porcius Festus succeeded Felix; and Felix, wanting to do the Jews a favor, left Paul bound."},"25":{"1":"Now when Festus had come to the province, after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.","2":"Then the high priest and the chief men of the Jews informed him against Paul; and they petitioned him,","3":"asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem\u2014while they lay in ambush along the road to kill him.","4":"But Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself was going there shortly.","5":"\u201cTherefore,\u201d he said, \u201clet those who have authority among you go down with me and accuse this man, to see if there is any fault in him.\u201d","6":"And when he had remained among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.","7":"When he had come, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood about and laid many serious complaints against Paul, which they could not prove,","8":"while he answered for himself, \u201cNeither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I offended in anything at all.\u201d","9":"But Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, answered Paul and said, \u201cAre you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be judged before me concerning these things?\u201d","10":"So Paul said, \u201cI stand at Caesar\u2019s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you very well know.","11":"For if I am an offender, or have committed anything deserving of death, I do not object to dying; but if there is nothing in these things of which these men accuse me, no one can deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar.\u201d","12":"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, \u201cYou have appealed to Caesar? To Caesar you shall go!\u201d Paul Before Agrippa","13":"And after some days King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to greet Festus.","14":"When they had been there many days, Festus laid Paul\u2019s case before the king, saying: \u201cThere is a certain man left a prisoner by Felix,","15":"about whom the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, when I was in Jerusalem, asking for a judgment against him.","16":"To them I answered, \u2018It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to destruction before the accused meets the accusers face to face, and has opportunity to answer for himself concerning the charge against him.\u2019","17":"Therefore when they had come together, without any delay, the next day I sat on the judgment seat and commanded the man to be brought in.","18":"When the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation against him of such things as I supposed,","19":"but had some questions against him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.","20":"And because I was uncertain of such questions, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these matters.","21":"But when Paul appealed to be reserved for the decision of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I could send him to Caesar.\u201d","22":"Then Agrippa said to Festus, \u201cI also would like to hear the man myself.\u201d \u201cTomorrow,\u201d he said, \u201cyou shall hear him.\u201d","23":"So the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with great pomp, and had entered the auditorium with the commanders and the prominent men of the city, at Festus\u2019 command Paul was brought in.","24":"And Festus said: \u201cKing Agrippa and all the men who are here present with us, you see this man about whom the whole assembly of the Jews petitioned me, both at Jerusalem and here, crying out that he was not fit to live any longer.","25":"But when I found that he had committed nothing deserving of death, and that he himself had appealed to Augustus, I decided to send him.","26":"I have nothing certain to write to my lord concerning him. Therefore I have brought him out before you, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that after the examination has taken place I may have something to write.","27":"For it seems to me unreasonable to send a prisoner and not to specify the charges against him.\u201d"},"26":{"1":"Then Agrippa said to Paul, \u201cYou are permitted to speak for yourself.\u201d So Paul stretched out his hand and answered for himself:","2":"\u201cI think myself happy, King Agrippa, because today I shall answer for myself before you concerning all the things of which I am accused by the Jews,","3":"especially because you are expert in all customs and questions which have to do with the Jews. Therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.","4":"\u201cMy manner of life from my youth, which was spent from the beginning among my own nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know.","5":"They knew me from the first, if they were willing to testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.","6":"And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made by God to our fathers.","7":"To this promise our twelve tribes, earnestly serving God night and day, hope to attain. For this hope\u2019s sake, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.","8":"Why should it be thought incredible by you that God raises the dead?","9":"\u201cIndeed, I myself thought I must do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.","10":"This I also did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.","11":"And I punished them often in every synagogue and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities. Paul Recounts His Conversion","12":"\u201cWhile thus occupied, as I journeyed to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,","13":"at midday, O king, along the road I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those who journeyed with me.","14":"And when we all had fallen to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language, \u2018Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.\u2019","15":"So I said, \u2018Who are You, Lord?\u2019 And He said, \u2018I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.","16":"But rise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to make you a minister and a witness both of the things which you have seen and of the things which I will yet reveal to you.","17":"I will deliver you from the Jewish people, as well as from the Gentiles, to whom I now send you,","18":"to open their eyes, in order to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.\u2019 Paul\u2019s Post-Conversion Life","19":"\u201cTherefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,","20":"but declared first to those in Damascus and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent, turn to God, and do works befitting repentance.","21":"For these reasons the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.","22":"Therefore, having obtained help from God, to this day I stand, witnessing both to small and great, saying no other things than those which the prophets and Moses said would come\u2014","23":"that the Christ would suffer, that He would be the first to rise from the dead, and would proclaim light to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.\u201d Agrippa Parries Paul\u2019s Challenge","24":"Now as he thus made his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, \u201cPaul, you are beside yourself! Much learning is driving you mad!\u201d","25":"But he said, \u201cI am not mad, most noble Festus, but speak the words of truth and reason.","26":"For the king, before whom I also speak freely, knows these things; for I am convinced that none of these things escapes his attention, since this thing was not done in a corner.","27":"King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you do believe.\u201d","28":"Then Agrippa said to Paul, \u201cYou almost persuade me to become a Christian.\u201d","29":"And Paul said, \u201cI would to God that not only you, but also all who hear me today, might become both almost and altogether such as I am, except for these chains.\u201d","30":"When he had said these things, the king stood up, as well as the governor and Bernice and those who sat with them;","31":"and when they had gone aside, they talked among themselves, saying, \u201cThis man is doing nothing deserving of death or chains.\u201d","32":"Then Agrippa said to Festus, \u201cThis man might have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar.\u201d"},"27":{"1":"And when it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to one named Julius, a centurion of the Augustan Regiment.","2":"So, entering a ship of Adramyttium, we put to sea, meaning to sail along the coasts of Asia. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, was with us.","3":"And the next day we landed at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him liberty to go to his friends and receive care.","4":"When we had put to sea from there, we sailed under the shelter of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.","5":"And when we had sailed over the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.","6":"There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he put us on board.","7":"When we had sailed slowly many days, and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, the wind not permitting us to proceed, we sailed under the shelter of Crete off Salmone.","8":"Passing it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea. Paul\u2019s Warning Ignored","9":"Now when much time had been spent, and sailing was now dangerous because the Fast was already over, Paul advised them,","10":"saying, \u201cMen, I perceive that this voyage will end with disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and ship, but also our lives.\u201d","11":"Nevertheless the centurion was more persuaded by the helmsman and the owner of the ship than by the things spoken by Paul.","12":"And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority advised to set sail from there also, if by any means they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete opening toward the southwest and northwest, and winter there. In the Tempest","13":"When the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained their desire, putting out to sea, they sailed close by Crete.","14":"But not long after, a tempestuous head wind arose, called Euroclydon.","15":"So when the ship was caught, and could not head into the wind, we let her drive.","16":"And running under the shelter of an island called Clauda, we secured the skiff with difficulty.","17":"When they had taken it on board, they used cables to undergird the ship; and fearing lest they should run aground on the Syrtis Sands, they struck sail and so were driven.","18":"And because we were exceedingly tempest-tossed, the next day they lightened the ship.","19":"On the third day we threw the ship\u2019s tackle overboard with our own hands.","20":"Now when neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest beat on us, all hope that we would be saved was finally given up.","21":"But after long abstinence from food, then Paul stood in the midst of them and said, \u201cMen, you should have listened to me, and not have sailed from Crete and incurred this disaster and loss.","22":"And now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.","23":"For there stood by me this night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve,","24":"saying, \u2018Do not be afraid, Paul; you must be brought before Caesar; and indeed God has granted you all those who sail with you.\u2019","25":"Therefore take heart, men, for I believe God that it will be just as it was told me.","26":"However, we must run aground on a certain island.\u201d","27":"Now when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven up and down in the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors sensed that they were drawing near some land.","28":"And they took soundings and found it to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they took soundings again and found it to be fifteen fathoms.","29":"Then, fearing lest we should run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern, and prayed for day to come.","30":"And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, when they had let down the skiff into the sea, under pretense of putting out anchors from the prow,","31":"Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, \u201cUnless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.\u201d","32":"Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff and let it fall off.","33":"And as day was about to dawn, Paul implored them all to take food, saying, \u201cToday is the fourteenth day you have waited and continued without food, and eaten nothing.","34":"Therefore I urge you to take nourishment, for this is for your survival, since not a hair will fall from the head of any of you.\u201d","35":"And when he had said these things, he took bread and gave thanks to God in the presence of them all; and when he had broken it he began to eat.","36":"Then they were all encouraged, and also took food themselves.","37":"And in all we were two hundred and seventy-six persons on the ship.","38":"So when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship and threw out the wheat into the sea. Shipwrecked on Malta","39":"When it was day, they did not recognize the land; but they observed a bay with a beach, onto which they planned to run the ship if possible.","40":"And they let go the anchors and left them in the sea, meanwhile loosing the rudder ropes; and they hoisted the mainsail to the wind and made for shore.","41":"But striking a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern was being broken up by the violence of the waves.","42":"And the soldiers\u2019 plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape.","43":"But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, kept them from their purpose, and commanded that those who could swim should jump overboard first and get to land,","44":"and the rest, some on boards and some on parts of the ship. And so it was that they all escaped safely to land."},"28":{"1":"Now when they had escaped, they then found out that the island was called Malta.","2":"And the natives showed us unusual kindness; for they kindled a fire and made us all welcome, because of the rain that was falling and because of the cold.","3":"But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and laid them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat, and fastened on his hand.","4":"So when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, \u201cNo doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he has escaped the sea, yet justice does not allow to live.\u201d","5":"But he shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.","6":"However, they were expecting that he would swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had looked for a long time and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.","7":"In that region there was an estate of the leading citizen of the island, whose name was Publius, who received us and entertained us courteously for three days.","8":"And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him and prayed, and he laid his hands on him and healed him.","9":"So when this was done, the rest of those on the island who had diseases also came and were healed.","10":"They also honored us in many ways; and when we departed, they provided such things as were necessary. Arrival at Rome","11":"After three months we sailed in an Alexandrian ship whose figurehead was the Twin Brothers, which had wintered at the island.","12":"And landing at Syracuse, we stayed three days.","13":"From there we circled round and reached Rhegium. And after one day the south wind blew; and the next day we came to Puteoli,","14":"where we found brethren, and were invited to stay with them seven days. And so we went toward Rome.","15":"And from there, when the brethren heard about us, they came to meet us as far as Appii Forum and Three Inns. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and took courage.","16":"Now when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but Paul was permitted to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him. Paul\u2019s Ministry at Rome","17":"And it came to pass after three days that Paul called the leaders of the Jews together. So when they had come together, he said to them: \u201cMen and brethren, though I have done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans,","18":"who, when they had examined me, wanted to let me go, because there was no cause for putting me to death.","19":"But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything of which to accuse my nation.","20":"For this reason therefore I have called for you, to see you and speak with you, because for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.\u201d","21":"Then they said to him, \u201cWe neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brethren who came reported or spoken any evil of you.","22":"But we desire to hear from you what you think; for concerning this sect, we know that it is spoken against everywhere.\u201d","23":"So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he explained and solemnly testified of the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening.","24":"And some were persuaded by the things which were spoken, and some disbelieved.","25":"So when they did not agree among themselves, they departed after Paul had said one word: \u201cThe Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,","26":"saying, \u2018Go to this people and say: \u201cHearing you will hear, and shall not understand; And seeing you will see, and not perceive;","27":"For the hearts of this people have grown dull. Their ears are hard of hearing, And their eyes they have closed, Lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, So that I should heal them.\u201d \u2019","28":"\u201cTherefore let it be known to you that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it!\u201d","29":"And when he had said these words, the Jews departed and had a great dispute among themselves.","30":"Then Paul dwelt two whole years in his own rented house, and received all who came to him,","31":"preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no one forbidding him."}}
