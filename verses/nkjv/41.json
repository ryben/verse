So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.","5":"When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, \u201cSon, your sins are forgiven you.\u201d","6":"And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,","7":"\u201cWhy does this Man speak blasphemies like this? Who can forgive sins but God alone?\u201d","8":"But immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, \u201cWhy do you reason about these things in your hearts?","9":"Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, \u2018Your sins are forgiven you,\u2019 or to say, \u2018Arise, take up your bed and walk\u2019?","10":"But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins\u201d\u2014He said to the paralytic,","11":"\u201cI say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.\u201d","12":"Immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went out in the presence of them all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, \u201cWe never saw anything like this!\u201d Matthew the Tax Collector","13":"Then He went out again by the sea; and all the multitude came to Him, and He taught them.","14":"As He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office.

A Great Multitude Follows Jesus","7":"But Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a great multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea","8":"and Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan; and those from Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard how many things He was doing, came to Him.","9":"So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the multitude, lest they should crush Him.","10":"For He healed many, so that as many as had afflictions pressed about Him to touch Him.","11":"And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, fell down before Him and cried out, saying, \u201cYou are the Son of God.\u201d","12":"But He sternly warned them that they should not make Him known. The Twelve Apostles","13":"And He went up on the mountain and called to Him those He Himself wanted. And they came to Him.","14":"Then He appointed twelve, that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach,","15":"and to have power to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:","16":"Simon, to whom He gave the name Peter;","17":"James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, to whom He gave the name Boanerges, that is, \u201cSons of Thunder\u201d;","18":"Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananite;","19":"and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.

The Unpardonable Sin","28":"\u201cAssuredly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they may utter;","29":"but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation\u201d\u2014","30":"because they said, \u201cHe has an unclean spirit.\u201d Jesus\u2019 Mother and Brothers Send for Him","31":"Then His brothers and His mother came, and standing outside they sent to Him, calling Him.","32":"And a multitude was sitting around Him; and they said to Him, \u201cLook, Your mother and Your brothers are outside seeking You.\u201d","33":"But He answered them, saying, \u201cWho is My mother, or My brothers?\u201d","34":"And He looked around in a circle at those who sat about Him, and said, \u201cHere are My mother and My brothers!","35":"For whoever does the will of God is My brother and My sister and mother.\u201d"},"4":{"1":"And again He began to teach by the sea. And a great multitude was gathered to Him, so that He got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole multitude was on the land facing the sea.","2":"Then He taught them many things by parables, and said to them in His teaching:","3":"\u201cListen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.","4":"And it happened, as he sowed, that some seed fell by the wayside; and the birds of the air came and devoured it.","5":"Some fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.","6":"But when the sun was up it was scorched, and because it had no root it withered away.","7":"And some seed fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no crop.","8":"But other seed fell on good ground and yielded a crop that sprang up, increased and produced: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.\u201d","9":"And He said to them, \u201cHe who has ears to hear, let him hear!\u201d The Purpose of Parables","10":"But when He was alone, those around Him with the twelve asked Him about the parable.","11":"And He said to them, \u201cTo you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, all things come in parables,","12":"so that \u2018Seeing they may see and not perceive, And hearing they may hear and not understand; Lest they should turn, And their sins be forgiven them.\u2019 \u201d The Parable of the Sower Explained","13":"And He said to them, \u201cDo you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?","14":"The sower sows the word.","15":"And these are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown. When they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts.","16":"These likewise are the ones sown on stony ground who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with gladness;","17":"and they have no root in themselves, and so endure only for a time. Afterward, when tribulation or persecution arises for the word\u2019s sake, immediately they stumble.","18":"Now these are the ones sown among thorns; they are the ones who hear the word,","19":"and the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.","20":"But these are the ones sown on good ground, those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.\u201d Light Under a Basket","21":"Also He said to them, \u201cIs a lamp brought to be put under a basket or under a bed? Is it not to be set on a lampstand?","22":"For there is nothing hidden which will not be revealed, nor has anything been kept secret but that it should come to light.","23":"If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear.\u201d","24":"Then He said to them, \u201cTake heed what you hear. With the same measure you use, it will be measured to you; and to you who hear, more will be given.","25":"For whoever has, to him more will be given; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.\u201d The Parable of the Growing Seed","26":"And He said, \u201cThe kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground,","27":"and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how.","28":"For the earth yields crops by itself: first the blade, then the head, after that the full grain in the head.","29":"But when the grain ripens, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.\u201d The Parable of the Mustard Seed","30":"Then He said, \u201cTo what shall we liken the kingdom of God? Or with what parable shall we picture it?","31":"It is like a mustard seed which, when it is sown on the ground, is smaller than all the seeds on earth;","32":"but when it is sown, it grows up and becomes greater than all herbs, and shoots out large branches, so that the birds of the air may nest under its shade.\u201d Jesus\u2019 Use of Parables","33":"And with many such parables He spoke the word to them as they were able to hear it.","34":"But without a parable He did not speak to them. And when they were alone, He explained all things to His disciples. Wind and Wave Obey Jesus","35":"On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, \u201cLet us cross over to the other side.\u201d","36":"Now when they had left the multitude, they took Him along in the boat as He was. And other little boats were also with Him.","37":"And a great windstorm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling.","38":"But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. And they awoke Him and said to Him, \u201cTeacher, do You not care that we are perishing?\u201d","39":"Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, \u201cPeace, be still!\u201d And the wind ceased and there was a great calm.","40":"But He said to them, \u201cWhy are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?\u201d","41":"And they feared exceedingly, and said to one another, \u201cWho can this be, that even the wind and the sea obey Him!\u201d"},"5":{"1":"Then they came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gadarenes.","2":"And when He had come out of the boat, immediately there met Him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,","3":"who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no one could bind him, not even with chains,","4":"because he had often been bound with shackles and chains. And the chains had been pulled apart by him, and the shackles broken in pieces; neither could anyone tame him.","5":"And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and cutting himself with stones.","6":"When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped Him.","7":"And he cried out with a loud voice and said, \u201cWhat have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore You by God that You do not torment me.\u201d","8":"For He said to him, \u201cCome out of the man, unclean spirit!\u201d","9":"Then He asked him, \u201cWhat is your name?\u201d And he answered, saying, \u201cMy name is Legion; for we are many.\u201d","10":"Also he begged Him earnestly that He would not send them out of the country.","11":"Now a large herd of swine was feeding there near the mountains.","12":"So all the demons begged Him, saying, \u201cSend us to the swine, that we may enter them.\u201d","13":"And at once Jesus gave them permission. Then the unclean spirits went out and entered the swine (there were about two thousand); and the herd ran violently down the steep place into the sea, and drowned in the sea.","14":"So those who fed the swine fled, and they told it in the city and in the country. And they went out to see what it was that had happened.","15":"Then they came to Jesus, and saw the one who had been demon-possessed and had the legion, sitting and clothed and in his right mind. And they were afraid.","16":"And those who saw it told them how it happened to him who had been demon-possessed, and about the swine.","17":"Then they began to plead with Him to depart from their region.","18":"And when He got into the boat, he who had been demon-possessed begged Him that he might be with Him.","19":"However, Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, \u201cGo home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you.\u201d","20":"And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him; and all marveled. A Girl Restored to Life and a Woman Healed","21":"Now when Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a great multitude gathered to Him; and He was by the sea.","22":"And behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue came, Jairus by name. And when he saw Him, he fell at His feet","23":"and begged Him earnestly, saying, \u201cMy little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and lay Your hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live.\u201d","24":"So Jesus went with him, and a great multitude followed Him and thronged Him.","25":"Now a certain woman had a flow of blood for twelve years,","26":"and had suffered many things from many physicians. She had spent all that she had and was no better, but rather grew worse.","27":"When she heard about Jesus, she came behind Him in the crowd and touched His garment.","28":"For she said, \u201cIf only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.\u201d","29":"Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of the affliction.","30":"And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, turned around in the crowd and said, \u201cWho touched My clothes?\u201d","31":"But His disciples said to Him, \u201cYou see the multitude thronging You, and You say, \u2018Who touched Me?\u2019 \u201d","32":"And He looked around to see her who had done this thing.","33":"But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.","34":"And He said to her, \u201cDaughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.\u201d","35":"While He was still speaking, some came from the ruler of the synagogue\u2019s house who said, \u201cYour daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?\u201d","36":"As soon as Jesus heard the word that was spoken, He said to the ruler of the synagogue, \u201cDo not be afraid; only believe.\u201d","37":"And He permitted no one to follow Him except Peter, James, and John the brother of James.","38":"Then He came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and saw a tumult and those who wept and wailed loudly.","39":"When He came in, He said to them, \u201cWhy make this commotion and weep? The child is not dead, but sleeping.\u201d","40":"And they ridiculed Him. But when He had put them all outside, He took the father and the mother of the child, and those who were with Him, and entered where the child was lying.","41":"Then He took the child by the hand, and said to her, \u201cTalitha, cumi,\u201d which is translated, \u201cLittle girl, I say to you, arise.\u201d","42":"Immediately the girl arose and walked, for she was twelve years of age. And they were overcome with great amazement.","43":"But He commanded them strictly that no one should know it, and said that something should be given her to eat."},"6":{"1":"Then He went out from there and came to His own country, and His disciples followed Him.","2":"And when the Sabbath had come, He began to teach in the synagogue. And many hearing Him were astonished, saying, \u201cWhere did this Man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to Him, that such mighty works are performed by His hands!","3":"Is this not the carpenter, the Son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?\u201d So they were offended at Him.","4":"But Jesus said to them, \u201cA prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own relatives, and in his own house.\u201d","5":"Now He could do no mighty work there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.","6":"And He marveled because of their unbelief. Then He went about the villages in a circuit, teaching. Sending Out the Twelve","7":"And He called the twelve to Himself, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them power over unclean spirits.","8":"He commanded them to take nothing for the journey except a staff\u2014no bag, no bread, no copper in their money belts\u2014","9":"but to wear sandals, and not to put on two tunics.","10":"Also He said to them, \u201cIn whatever place you enter a house, stay there till you depart from that place.","11":"And whoever will not receive you nor hear you, when you depart from there, shake off the dust under your feet as a testimony against them. Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!\u201d","12":"So they went out and preached that people should repent.","13":"And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many who were sick, and healed them. John the Baptist Beheaded","14":"Now King Herod heard of Him, for His name had become well known. And he said, \u201cJohn the Baptist is risen from the dead, and therefore these powers are at work in him.\u201d","15":"Others said, \u201cIt is Elijah.\u201d And others said, \u201cIt is the Prophet, or like one of the prophets.\u201d","16":"But when Herod heard, he said, \u201cThis is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!\u201d","17":"For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip\u2019s wife; for he had married her.","18":"Because John had said to Herod, \u201cIt is not lawful for you to have your brother\u2019s wife.\u201d","19":"Therefore Herodias held it against him and wanted to kill him, but she could not;","20":"for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and he protected him. And when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.","21":"Then an opportune day came when Herod on his birthday gave a feast for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee.","22":"And when Herodias\u2019 daughter herself came in and danced, and pleased Herod and those who sat with him, the king said to the girl, \u201cAsk me whatever you want, and I will give it to you.\u201d","23":"He also swore to her, \u201cWhatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half my kingdom.\u201d","24":"So she went out and said to her mother, \u201cWhat shall I ask?\u201d And she said, \u201cThe head of John the Baptist!\u201d","25":"Immediately she came in with haste to the king and asked, saying, \u201cI want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter.\u201d","26":"And the king was exceedingly sorry; yet, because of the oaths and because of those who sat with him, he did not want to refuse her.","27":"Immediately the king sent an executioner and commanded his head to be brought. And he went and beheaded him in prison,","28":"brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.","29":"When his disciples heard of it, they came and took away his corpse and laid it in a tomb. Feeding the Five Thousand","30":"Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and told Him all things, both what they had done and what they had taught.","31":"And He said to them, \u201cCome aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.\u201d For there were many coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat.","32":"So they departed to a deserted place in the boat by themselves.","33":"But the multitudes saw them departing, and many knew Him and ran there on foot from all the cities.

But you have made it a \u2018den of thieves.\u2019 \u201d","18":"And the scribes and chief priests heard it and sought how they might destroy Him; for they feared Him, because all the people were astonished at His teaching.","19":"When evening had come, He went out of the city. The Lesson of the Withered Fig Tree","20":"Now in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.","21":"And Peter, remembering, said to Him, \u201cRabbi, look! The fig tree which You cursed has withered away.\u201d","22":"So Jesus answered and said to them, \u201cHave faith in God.","23":"For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, \u2018Be removed and be cast into the sea,\u2019 and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says.","24":"Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them. Forgiveness and Prayer","25":"\u201cAnd whenever you stand praying, if you have anything against anyone, forgive him, that your Father in heaven may also forgive you your trespasses.","26":"But if you do not forgive, neither will your Father in heaven forgive your trespasses.\u201d Jesus\u2019 Authority Questioned","27":"Then they came again to Jerusalem. And as He was walking in the temple, the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders came to Him.","28":"And they said to Him, \u201cBy what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority to do these things?\u201d","29":"But Jesus answered and said to them, \u201cI also will ask you one question; then answer Me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things:","30":"The baptism of John\u2014was it from heaven or from men? Answer Me.\u201d","31":"And they reasoned among themselves, saying, \u201cIf we say, \u2018From heaven,\u2019 He will say, \u2018Why then did you not believe him?\u2019","32":"But if we say, \u2018From men\u2019 \u201d\u2014they feared the people, for all counted John to have been a prophet indeed.","33":"So they answered and said to Jesus, \u201cWe do not know.\u201d And Jesus answered and said to them, \u201cNeither will I tell you by what authority I do these things.\u201d"},"12":{"1":"Then He began to speak to them in parables: \u201cA man planted a vineyard and set a hedge around it, dug a place for the wine vat and built a tower. And he leased it to vinedressers and went into a far country.","2":"Now at vintage-time he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that he might receive some of the fruit of the vineyard from the vinedressers.","3":"And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.","4":"Again he sent them another servant, and at him they threw stones, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.","5":"And again he sent another, and him they killed; and many others, beating some and killing some.","6":"Therefore still having one son, his beloved, he also sent him to them last, saying, \u2018They will respect my son.\u2019","7":"But those vinedressers said among themselves, \u2018This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.\u2019","8":"So they took him and killed him and cast him out of the vineyard.","9":"\u201cTherefore what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the vinedressers, and give the vineyard to others.","10":"Have you not even read this Scripture: \u2018The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone.","11":"This was the Lord\u2019s doing, And it is marvelous in our eyes\u2019?\u201d","12":"And they sought to lay hands on Him, but feared the multitude, for they knew He had spoken the parable against them. So they left Him and went away. The Pharisees: Is It Lawful to Pay Taxes to Caesar?","13":"Then they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, to catch Him in His words.","14":"When they had come, they said to Him, \u201cTeacher, we know that You are true, and care about no one; for You do not regard the person of men, but teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?","15":"Shall we pay, or shall we not pay?\u201d But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, \u201cWhy do you test Me? Bring Me a denarius that I may see it. \u201d","16":"So they brought it. And He said to them, \u201cWhose image and inscription is this?\u201d They said to Him, \u201cCaesar\u2019s.\u201d","17":"And Jesus answered and said to them, \u201cRender to Caesar the things that are Caesar\u2019s, and to God the things that are God\u2019s.\u201d And they marveled at Him. The Sadducees: What About the Resurrection?","18":"Then some Sadducees, who say there is no resurrection, came to Him; and they asked Him, saying:","19":"\u201cTeacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man\u2019s brother dies, and leaves his wife behind, and leaves no children, his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.","20":"Now there were seven brothers. The first took a wife; and dying, he left no offspring.","21":"And the second took her, and he died; nor did he leave any offspring. And the third likewise.","22":"So the seven had her and left no offspring. Last of all the woman died also.","23":"Therefore, in the resurrection, when they rise, whose wife will she be? For all seven had her as wife.\u201d","24":"Jesus answered and said to them, \u201cAre you not therefore mistaken, because you do not know the Scriptures nor the power of God?","25":"For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.","26":"But concerning the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the burning bush passage, how God spoke to him, saying, \u2018I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob\u2019?","27":"He is not the God of the dead, but the God of the living. You are therefore greatly mistaken.\u201d The Scribes: Which Is the First Commandment of All?","28":"Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, \u201cWhich is the first commandment of all?\u201d","29":"Jesus answered him, \u201cThe first of all the commandments is: \u2018Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.","30":"And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.\u2019 This is the first commandment.","31":"And the second, like it, is this: \u2018You shall love your neighbor as yourself.\u2019 There is no other commandment greater than these.\u201d","32":"So the scribe said to Him, \u201cWell said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but He.","33":"And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one\u2019s neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.\u201d","34":"Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, \u201cYou are not far from the kingdom of God.\u201d But after that no one dared question Him. Jesus: How Can David Call His Descendant Lord?","35":"Then Jesus answered and said, while He taught in the temple, \u201cHow is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the Son of David?","36":"For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: \u2018The Lord said to my Lord, \u201cSit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.\u201d \u2019","37":"Therefore David himself calls Him \u2018Lord\u2019; how is He then his Son?\u201d And the common people heard Him gladly. Beware of the Scribes","38":"Then He said to them in His teaching, \u201cBeware of the scribes, who desire to go around in long robes, love greetings in the marketplaces,","39":"the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts,","40":"who devour widows\u2019 houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation.\u201d The Widow\u2019s Two Mites","41":"Now Jesus sat opposite the treasury and saw how the people put money into the treasury. And many who were rich put in much.","42":"Then one poor widow came and threw in two mites, which make a quadrans.","43":"So He called His disciples to Himself and said to them, \u201cAssuredly, I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all those who have given to the treasury;","44":"for they all put in out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all that she had, her whole livelihood.\u201d"},"13":{"1":"Then as He went out of the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, \u201cTeacher, see what manner of stones and what buildings are here! \u201d","2":"And Jesus answered and said to him, \u201cDo you see these great buildings? Not one stone shall be left upon another, that shall not be thrown down.\u201d The Signs of the Times and the End of the Age","3":"Now as He sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately,","4":"\u201cTell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when all these things will be fulfilled?\u201d","5":"And Jesus, answering them, began to say: \u201cTake heed that no one deceives you.","6":"For many will come in My name, saying, \u2018I am He, \u2019 and will deceive many.","7":"But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be troubled; for such things must happen, but the end is not yet.","8":"For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and troubles. These are the beginnings of sorrows.","9":"\u201cBut watch out for yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be beaten in the synagogues. You will be brought before rulers and kings for My sake, for a testimony to them.","10":"And the gospel must first be preached to all the nations.","11":"But when they arrest you and deliver you up, do not worry beforehand, or premeditate what you will speak. But whatever is given you in that hour, speak that; for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit.","12":"Now brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and cause them to be put to death.","13":"And you will be hated by all for My name\u2019s sake. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. The Great Tribulation","14":"\u201cSo when you see the \u2018abomination of desolation,\u2019 spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where it ought not\u201d (let the reader understand), \u201cthen let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.","15":"Let him who is on the housetop not go down into the house, nor enter to take anything out of his house.","16":"And let him who is in the field not go back to get his clothes.","17":"But woe to those who are pregnant and to those who are nursing babies in those days!","18":"And pray that your flight may not be in winter.","19":"For in those days there will be tribulation, such as has not been since the beginning of the creation which God created until this time, nor ever shall be.","20":"And unless the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh would be saved; but for the elect\u2019s sake, whom He chose, He shortened the days.","21":"\u201cThen if anyone says to you, \u2018Look, here is the Christ!\u2019 or, \u2018Look, He is there!\u2019 do not believe it.","22":"For false christs and false prophets will rise and show signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.","23":"But take heed; see, I have told you all things beforehand. The Coming of the Son of Man","24":"\u201cBut in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light;","25":"the stars of heaven will fall, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken.","26":"Then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory.","27":"And then He will send His angels, and gather together His elect from the four winds, from the farthest part of earth to the farthest part of heaven. The Parable of the Fig Tree","28":"\u201cNow learn this parable from the fig tree: When its branch has already become tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.","29":"So you also, when you see these things happening, know that it is near\u2014at the doors!","30":"Assuredly, I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away till all these things take place.","31":"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no means pass away. No One Knows the Day or Hour","32":"\u201cBut of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.","33":"Take heed, watch and pray; for you do not know when the time is.","34":"It is like a man going to a far country, who left his house and gave authority to his servants, and to each his work, and commanded the doorkeeper to watch.","35":"Watch therefore, for you do not know when the master of the house is coming\u2014in the evening, at midnight, at the crowing of the rooster, or in the morning\u2014","36":"lest, coming suddenly, he find you sleeping.","37":"And what I say to you, I say to all: Watch!\u201d"},"14":{"1":"After two days it was the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might take Him by trickery and put Him to death.","2":"But they said, \u201cNot during the feast, lest there be an uproar of the people.\u201d The Anointing at Bethany","3":"And being in Bethany at the house of Simon the leper, as He sat at the table, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly oil of spikenard. Then she broke the flask and poured it on His head.","4":"But there were some who were indignant among themselves, and said, \u201cWhy was this fragrant oil wasted?","5":"For it might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor.\u201d And they criticized her sharply.","6":"But Jesus said, \u201cLet her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a good work for Me.","7":"For you have the poor with you always, and whenever you wish you may do them good; but Me you do not have always.","8":"She has done what she could. She has come beforehand to anoint My body for burial.","9":"Assuredly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told as a memorial to her.\u201d Judas Agrees to Betray Jesus","10":"Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went to the chief priests to betray Him to them.","11":"And when they heard it, they were glad, and promised to give him money. So he sought how he might conveniently betray Him. Jesus Celebrates the Passover with His Disciples","12":"Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they killed the Passover lamb, His disciples said to Him, \u201cWhere do You want us to go and prepare, that You may eat the Passover?\u201d","13":"And He sent out two of His disciples and said to them, \u201cGo into the city, and a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him.","14":"Wherever he goes in, say to the master of the house, \u2018The Teacher says, \u201cWhere is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?\u201d \u2019","15":"Then he will show you a large upper room, furnished and prepared; there make ready for us.\u201d","16":"So His disciples went out, and came into the city, and found it just as He had said to them; and they prepared the Passover.","17":"In the evening He came with the twelve.","18":"Now as they sat and ate, Jesus said, \u201cAssuredly, I say to you, one of you who eats with Me will betray Me.\u201d","19":"And they began to be sorrowful, and to say to Him one by one, \u201cIs it I?\u201d And another said, \u201cIs it I?\u201d","20":"He answered and said to them, \u201cIt is one of the twelve, who dips with Me in the dish.","21":"The Son of Man indeed goes just as it is written of Him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had never been born.\u201d Jesus Institutes the Lord\u2019s Supper","22":"And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to them and said, \u201cTake, eat; this is My body.\u201d","23":"Then He took the cup, and when He had given thanks He gave it to them, and they all drank from it.","24":"And He said to them, \u201cThis is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many.","25":"Assuredly, I say to you, I will no longer drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God.\u201d","26":"And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. Jesus Predicts Peter\u2019s Denial","27":"Then Jesus said to them, \u201cAll of you will be made to stumble because of Me this night, for it is written: \u2018I will strike the Shepherd, And the sheep will be scattered.\u2019","28":"\u201cBut after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee.\u201d","29":"Peter said to Him, \u201cEven if all are made to stumble, yet I will not be. \u201d","30":"Jesus said to him, \u201cAssuredly, I say to you that today, even this night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.\u201d","31":"But he spoke more vehemently, \u201cIf I have to die with You, I will not deny You!\u201d And they all said likewise. The Prayer in the Garden","32":"Then they came to a place which was named Gethsemane; and He said to His disciples, \u201cSit here while I pray.\u201d","33":"And He took Peter, James, and John with Him, and He began to be troubled and deeply distressed.","34":"Then He said to them, \u201cMy soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death. Stay here and watch.\u201d","35":"He went a little farther, and fell on the ground, and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from Him.","36":"And He said, \u201cAbba, Father, all things are possible for You. Take this cup away from Me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will. \u201d","37":"Then He came and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, \u201cSimon, are you sleeping? Could you not watch one hour?","38":"Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.\u201d","39":"Again He went away and prayed, and spoke the same words.","40":"And when He returned, He found them asleep again, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what to answer Him.","41":"Then He came the third time and said to them, \u201cAre you still sleeping and resting? It is enough! The hour has come; behold, the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.","42":"Rise, let us be going. See, My betrayer is at hand.\u201d Betrayal and Arrest in Gethsemane","43":"And immediately, while He was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude with swords and clubs, came from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders.","44":"Now His betrayer had given them a signal, saying, \u201cWhomever I kiss, He is the One; seize Him and lead Him away safely.\u201d","45":"As soon as he had come, immediately he went up to Him and said to Him, \u201cRabbi, Rabbi!\u201d and kissed Him.","46":"Then they laid their hands on Him and took Him.","47":"And one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his ear.","48":"Then Jesus answered and said to them, \u201cHave you come out, as against a robber, with swords and clubs to take Me?","49":"I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize Me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled.\u201d","50":"Then they all forsook Him and fled. A Young Man Flees Naked","51":"Now a certain young man followed Him, having a linen cloth thrown around his naked body. And the young men laid hold of him,","52":"and he left the linen cloth and fled from them naked. Jesus Faces the Sanhedrin","53":"And they led Jesus away to the high priest; and with him were assembled all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes.","54":"But Peter followed Him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he sat with the servants and warmed himself at the fire.","55":"Now the chief priests and all the council sought testimony against Jesus to put Him to death, but found none.","56":"For many bore false witness against Him, but their testimonies did not agree.","57":"Then some rose up and bore false witness against Him, saying,","58":"\u201cWe heard Him say, \u2018I will destroy this temple made with hands, and within three days I will build another made without hands.\u2019 \u201d","59":"But not even then did their testimony agree.","60":"And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, saying, \u201cDo You answer nothing? What is it these men testify against You?\u201d","61":"But He kept silent and answered nothing. Again the high priest asked Him, saying to Him, \u201cAre You the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?\u201d","62":"Jesus said, \u201cI am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.\u201d","63":"Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, \u201cWhat further need do we have of witnesses?","64":"You have heard the blasphemy! What do you think?\u201d And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.","65":"Then some began to spit on Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him, and to say to Him, \u201cProphesy!\u201d And the officers struck Him with the palms of their hands. Peter Denies Jesus, and Weeps","66":"Now as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came.","67":"And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, \u201cYou also were with Jesus of Nazareth.\u201d","68":"But he denied it, saying, \u201cI neither know nor understand what you are saying.\u201d And he went out on the porch, and a rooster crowed.","69":"And the servant girl saw him again, and began to say to those who stood by, \u201cThis is one of them.\u201d","70":"But he denied it again. And a little later those who stood by said to Peter again, \u201cSurely you are one of them; for you are a Galilean, and your speech shows it. \u201d","71":"Then he began to curse and swear, \u201cI do not know this Man of whom you speak!\u201d","72":"A second time the rooster crowed. Then Peter called to mind the word that Jesus had said to him, \u201cBefore the rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times.\u201d And when he thought about it, he wept."},"15":{"1":"Immediately, in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole council; and they bound Jesus, led Him away, and delivered Him to Pilate.","2":"Then Pilate asked Him, \u201cAre You the King of the Jews?\u201d He answered and said to him, \u201cIt is as you say.\u201d","3":"And the chief priests accused Him of many things, but He answered nothing.","4":"Then Pilate asked Him again, saying, \u201cDo You answer nothing? See how many things they testify against You!\u201d","5":"But Jesus still answered nothing, so that Pilate marveled. Taking the Place of Barabbas","6":"Now at the feast he was accustomed to releasing one prisoner to them, whomever they requested.","7":"And there was one named Barabbas, who was chained with his fellow rebels; they had committed murder in the rebellion.","8":"Then the multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do just as he had always done for them.","9":"But Pilate answered them, saying, \u201cDo you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?\u201d","10":"For he knew that the chief priests had handed Him over because of envy.","11":"But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, so that he should rather release Barabbas to them.","12":"Pilate answered and said to them again, \u201cWhat then do you want me to do with Him whom you call the King of the Jews?\u201d","13":"So they cried out again, \u201cCrucify Him!\u201d","14":"Then Pilate said to them, \u201cWhy, what evil has He done?\u201d But they cried out all the more, \u201cCrucify Him!\u201d","15":"So Pilate, wanting to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered Jesus, after he had scourged Him, to be crucified. The Soldiers Mock Jesus","16":"Then the soldiers led Him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they called together the whole garrison.","17":"And they clothed Him with purple; and they twisted a crown of thorns, put it on His head,","18":"and began to salute Him, \u201cHail, King of the Jews!\u201d","19":"Then they struck Him on the head with a reed and spat on Him; and bowing the knee, they worshiped Him.","20":"And when they had mocked Him, they took the purple off Him, put His own clothes on Him, and led Him out to crucify Him. The King on a Cross","21":"Then they compelled a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming out of the country and passing by, to bear His cross.","22":"And they brought Him to the place Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.","23":"Then they gave Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He did not take it.","24":"And when they crucified Him, they divided His garments, casting lots for them to determine what every man should take.","25":"Now it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.","26":"And the inscription of His accusation was written above: THE KING OF THE JEWS.","27":"With Him they also crucified two robbers, one on His right and the other on His left.","28":"So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, \u201cAnd He was numbered with the transgressors.\u201d","29":"And those who passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads and saying, \u201cAha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,","30":"save Yourself, and come down from the cross!\u201d","31":"Likewise the chief priests also, mocking among themselves with the scribes, said, \u201cHe saved others; Himself He cannot save.","32":"Let the Christ, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe.\u201d Even those who were crucified with Him reviled Him.
